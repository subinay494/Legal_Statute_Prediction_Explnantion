# Legal_Statute_Prediction_Explnantion
The task of Legal Statute Prediction (LSP) focuses on identifying legal statutes that are relevant to a given description of facts or evidence within legal documents. Existing methods lack a focus on the underlying reasoning behind these predictions.  Addressing this research gap, we curate $\texttt{PROSLEX}$ (**PR**ediction **O**f **S**tatute and **LE**gal e**X**planation), the largest legal expert-annotated dataset for legal statute prediction with explanation in the Indian context, comprising 1623 documents. </br>
