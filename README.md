# Legal_Statute_Prediction_Explnantion
The task of Legal Statute Prediction (LSP) focuses on identifying legal statutes that are relevant to a given description of facts or evidence within legal documents. Existing methods lack a focus on the underlying reasoning behind these predictions.  Addressing this research gap, we curate $\texttt{PROSLEX}$ (**PR**ediction **O**f **S**tatute and **LE**gal e**X**planation), the largest legal expert-annotated dataset for legal statute prediction with explanation in the Indian context, comprising 1623 documents. </br>

This workflow illustrates a legal prediction framework to identify applicable Indian Penal Code (IPC) statutes for legal cases with the reasoning. The diagram shows a workflow where a legal corpus is annotated by legal experts to create a training set of case facts paired with relevant statutes and explanations. The left side displays an example case involving Bheemanna's assault and death, with highlighted text mapped to IPC sections 302 (\emph{murder}) and 147 (\emph{rioting}). The system uses a retrieval model to find similar cases, then employs in-context learning techniques like few-shot examples and chain-of-thought reasoning to make predictions on unlabeled cases. The bottom portion demonstrates the model analyzing a test document about dowry harassment and correctly predicting applicable statutes (IPC 302 for a \emph{kerosene burning death} and IPC 498A for \emph{dowry harassment}).
