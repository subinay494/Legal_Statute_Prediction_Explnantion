One such gang was operating in the city under Amar Naik @ Bhai, who died a couple of years before the decision in the case at an encounter with the police. The prosecution alleged that in pursuance of a criminal conspiracy between 1994 to 1994 the accused persons and others of the gang embarked upon preparatory acts like procuring the information about the names of the builders of M/s Kalpataru Construction Company which was engaged in developing a property at Pali Hill, named Nakshatra Building. PW-7 Sudhir Tambe was the Senior Vice-President of the company with its head office at Nariman Point. He used to sit in the head- office. PW 6 Pachapur, Civil Engineer, was an employee of the company who used to remain at the site to supervise the construction. As the prosecution story runs, on 1994 between 30 a.m. and 00 noon while PW 6 was on duty at the construction site, accused no.3, Nitin Vasant Venugurlekar armed with revolver and accused no.4 Rajindera @ Rajan Mahadeo Margaj armed with a chopper and accused no.5 Jayendra @ Jai Anandrao Jadhav also armed with a chopper visited the site of Nakshatra Building; they threatened the workers at the site, forcibly brought PW 6 Pachapur in a room on the ground floor and man-handled him. Accused no.3, pointing a revolver at him demanded the name, address and telephone number of the builders. PW 6 disclosed the name of PW 7 Tambe and gave his telephone number to them. The accused then asked him to go to the office of the builders at Nariman Point and make the arrangement for a telephonic talk with Tambe. PW 6 rushed to the office and told Tambe of what had happened at the construction site. This was followed by telephonic calls from the accused who wanted to speak to Tambe. Attempts were made by PW 6 and PW 7 to avoid any discussion with the gangsters. Two or three days thereafter when the accused got Tambe on the telephone he (Tambe) gave them some other telephone numbers and asked them to contact those persons including one D.N.Ghosh, the Security Contractor. Eight/ten days thereafter again a telephone call was made to the office of Tambe which was received by PW 6 who was informed by the person making the call that they could not get D. N. Ghosh on the telephone numbers furnished by Tambe. Thereafter PW 6 handed over the receiver to Tambe. This incident was followed by several threats given by the gangsters to workers and also repeated telephone calls made to the Head Office of the company to contact Tambe. The staff of the site office absented from work resulting in virtual closure of construction activity. On 1994 the deceased Sanjay Patil telephoned to Tambe and warned him that he is wasting time and should meet him without further delay. After some days there was one more similar call from Sanjay Patil and he asked Tambe that he should talk to Bhai and saying so he handed over the receiver to another person who gave his identity as Amar Naik (since deceased), who told Tambe that he should pay rs.10 lacs. The later pleaded his inability to pay such a heavy sum and after some discussion agreed to pay rs.5 lacs. He was asked to come to Nakshatra Building site on 1994 along with money. In the meantime Tambe informed all the happenings to the Addl. Commissioner of Police Mr. Sanjeev Dayal and the then Dy. Commissioner of Police of Zone VII Mr. Rajanish Sheth within whose jurisdiction Khar Police Station fell. On 1994 at about 00 noon the deceased Sanjay Patil telephoned Tambe and inquired from him as to what he was going to do about the payment and then Tambe replied that he will be leaving office at about 00 p.m. for Pali Hill. Sanjay Patil cautioned him that he should not make any haste and he should wait for his call so that he will take necessary instructions from his boss i.e. Amar Naik. At about 00 p.m. on that day there was a telephone call from Sanjay Patil telling that Tambe should not meet him at the Nakshatra Building site but instead he should meet him near the Ceaser Palace Hotel. This telephonic conversation was tape-recorded. Tambe was instructed on telephone that his man shall carry a white plastic bag containing the amount of rs.5 lacs and shall wait near the entrance gate of Ceaser Palace Hotel and the person coming to collect the said bag will introduce himself as Me Rawanacha Manus Hai. Tambe informed to the DCP all these happenings and handed over the tape in which the telephonic conversation was recorded by him. The DCP had made the arrangements to keep a regular watch near the building site. PW 1 Sunil Deshmukh was deployed to wait in cognito near the gate of the Ceaser Palace Hotel and to carry the white plastic bag containing bundles of papers which would give an appearance like the bundles of currency notes. The other officers, who were also in cognito, had taken their position at strategic points near the hotel. At about 05 p.m. Sunil Deshmukh noticed that one red coloured Maruti van halted in front of the Ceaser Palace Hotel. He noticed three persons getting down from the said van. Those three persons were coming in his direction, and the van went ahead 50 to 60 feets and halted there.

Narendra Kumar, the father of the appellants, is presently working as Professor/Medical Director of Neonatal Intensive Care Unit [NICU] and also performing medical practice at 2917, Middleboro Place, Modesto, California. Both the appellants were born in California and completed their schooling in USA. They decided to get admission in MBBS course for the academic session 1996-97 in Santosh Medical College, Ghaziabad [for short College] against NRI quota after remitting US $50,000 and US $49,700 respectively towards capitation fees and additional hostel fees of RS. 75,000 and rs. 45,000 and security deposits for one year. That apart, the College took a loan of rs. 25 lakhs on interest @ 5% p.a. from the father of the appellants and its payment was assured by a handwritten slip. The disputes and differences arose after the father of the appellants demanded repayment of the loan from Dr. Mahalingam the second respondent herein, Chairman & Managing Director/Trustee of Maharaji Educational Trust and Santosh Medical College and Hospital, Pratap Vihar, Vijay Nagar, Ghaziabad. In April 2001, the matter was reported to the Additional District Magistrate, Ghaziabad, for taking appropriate steps to get the loan amount refunded. Mahalingam the second respondent in his letter dated 2001 acknowledged the liability and had also assured to refund the entire loan amount. It was alleged that the second respondent with vindictive attitude started harassing the appellants and in the result declared in July 2000, Dr. Monica Kumar the first appellant was got failed in both theory papers of Pharmacology and she was not allowed to appear in two subsequent supplementary examinations as well as in Final Professional MBBS Part-I Examination. The first appellant filed a Writ Petition no. 9150 of 2001 in the High Court wherein vide order dated 2001, the second respondent was directed to permit the first appellant to appear in the final Professional MBBS Part-I Examination. In compliance of the High Courts order, the first appellant was permitted to appear in the examination, but her result was deliberately withheld for an oblique motive which compelled the first appellant to approach the High Court of Allahabad by way of Miscellaneous Application in the pending Writ Petition no. 9150/2001 for issuing necessary directions for declaration of her result. The High Court vide order dated 2001 directed the College authorities to declare the results of MBBS Final Professional Part-I Examination, 2001 and the result of the scrutiny of Pharmacology of Second Professional Examination, 2000 and further to permit the first appellant to appear in Final MBBS Part-II Examination and to declare the result of the said examination as well. By Orders dated 2002/2002, the High Court directed the college authorities to produce answer books of Pharmacology of the first appellant. On 2002, the High Court got the answer books of the first appellant re-examined by the Head of Department of Pharmacology of Motilal Nehru Medical College, Allahabad in the court itself. On re- examination of the papers, the first appellant secured good marks in both the papers and accordingly, the college authorities were directed to declare her results forthwith. It appears that the orders/directions of the High Court were not complied with which gave rise to the first appellant to file contempt of court proceedings against the college authorities. The High Court vide order dated 2002 directed the College authorities to be present personally in the Court but in the meantime on 2002 the result was declared and for no valid reasons, the first appellant was declared failed in Surgery Practical Examination. The first appellant left with no other remedy, but to approach the High Court by means of another writ petition. The High Court directed the second respondent to produce before it the tabulation chart of Surgery Practical Examination of all the students including the first appellant. The High Court on 2002 having noticed serious allegations of mala fide, restrained Dr. Mahalingam the second respondent from interfering in and conducting examination of the first appellant and further directed that the practical examination of the first appellant be got conducted through Agra Medical College in which the first appellant was declared pass with 70% marks. The appellants alleged that having miserably failed in all attempts to ruin the career of the first appellant, Dr. Mahalingam the second respondent on 2003 got a false and frivolous report lodged under Sections 504 and 506 Indian Penal Code, 1860 through his yes-man and associate Dr. Anil Tomar against all the members of the appellants family whereupon Case Crime no. 286 of 2003 was registered against them. Both the appellants and their parents filed Writ Petition no. 1923 of 2003 seeking for quashing the said criminal case and the High Court vide order dated 2003, stayed the arrest of the appellants and their parents during the investigation of the above-said FIR. The Police rushed to file charge sheet without making any fair and effective investigation against which Criminal Miscellaneous Application no. 8542 of 2003 under Section 482 Cr. P.C. was filed by the parents of the appellants in the High Court for quashing the charge sheet and the High Court vide its order stayed further proceedings pending before the trial court. On a complaint made by the father of the appellants and on intervention of the District Magistrate and sectionS.P. , Ghaziabad, Dr. Mahalingam the second respondent on 2003 allegedly, gave 5 cheques for rs. 5 lakhs each against the loan amount and two demand drafts of rs. 5 lacs each on account of payment of the accrued interest. It was stated that one cheque was dishonoured on 2003 and the father of appellants preferred a Criminal Case no. 7272 of 2003 against Dr. Mahalingam the second respondent under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act in the Court of Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Ghaziabad wherein by order dated 2004 the second respondent and others were summoned as accused persons. On filing of the above criminal case by the father of the appellants, the second respondent got infuriated and became more and more vindictive against the appellants and their family members. The appellants then stated that the tape recorded conversation held between the father of the appellants and Dr. Shrivastava, Principal of the College, would clearly reveal that Dr. Mahalingam the second respondent is the main person instrumental in victimisation and harassing of the appellants. On 2004 and 2004 the appellants were allegedly assaulted mercilessly by the second respondent, Anil Somania, Station Officer, P.S. Vijay Nagar and their drivers. The first appellant was molested and she had been threatened to be kidnapped, raped and even murdered whereas the Dr. Manish Kumar- the second appellant, brother of the first appellant was assaulted with kicks, fists, shoes and sticks. They got themselves medically examined at the Government M.M.G. Hospital, Ghaziabad and on refusal to register their FIR by the Police of Police Station, Ghaziabad, the appellants proceeded to file an application under Section 156(3) Cr. P.C. before Chief Judicial Magistrate, Ghaziabad seeking direction to the police to register the FIR and hold proper investigation in the case. Though the said application was initially rejected by the Chief Judicial Magistrate, but in view of the order of the IIIrd Additional District and Sessions Judge, Ghaziabad, the Chief Judicial Magistrate by order dated 2005 directed the concerned Police Station Officer to register the case against the culprits. Aggrieved thereby, Dr. Mahalingam the second respondent filed a Criminal Writ Petition before the High Court which was dismissed vide order dated In pursuance of the order of the Chief Judicial Magistrate dated 2005 and subsequent order of the High Court dated 2005, FIR at the instance of Dr. Monica bearing Crime no. 425 of 2005 was registered on 2005 under Sections 147/323/342/352/354/427/504 and 506 Indian Penal Code, 1860 at the Police Station against Dr. Mahalingam and other persons named in the complaint.", "statute": ["s7", "s5"]}, "2013.INSC.152.txt": {"doc_url": "http://www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/2013/152.html", "explanation": {"B.Aggrieved, m/s.Manish Engineering Enterprises made a representation dated 2001, to IFFCO requesting it to make payments for the work allegedly done by it.": ["s7"], "F.m/s.Manish Engineering Enterprises filed a Claim Petition on various counts, including one for an amount of rs.9,27,182/- towards the alleged removal of items from their godown within the IFFCO premises.": ["s2"]}, "fact": " A.m/s.Manish Engineering Enterprises of which respondent no.2, Sudha Kant Pandey, claims to be the proprietor, was given a work order by m/s.Indian Farmers Fertilizer Cooperative Ltd.(hereinafter referred to as IFFCO), Phulpur unit, on 1996 for the purpose of conducting repairs in their plant worth an estimated value of rs.13,88,750/-.

He asserted that all throughout his service record was good and satisfactory. He was sincere and efficient and has worked with dedication. At several occasions, he received appreciation for his work. There was no grievance or complaint by the authorities and he continued to be a 'devoted employee' of the Corporation. It was, no doubt, stated that in 1987, a charge sheet was issued against him but according to the appellant, subsequently, the Corporation was satisfied on the explanation submitted by the appellant that there was no substance in the allegations and the same was, therefore, withdrawn. On 11th March, 1988, the appellant was promoted as Operator 'A' Special Grade. It is the case of the appellant that his next door neighbour was one Mrs. Parul Jana, who was Sister-in-Charge in the Refinery Hospital at Haldia. Parul Jana was treating the appellant as her brother. The relationship between both the families was close and cordial and whenever necessary, Parul Jana used to call the appellant as one of her family members. Parul Jana suddenly developed heart problem in May, She was, therefore, required to be admitted for treatment in Apollo Hospital, Madras. At late night hours on 5th May, 1999, two sons of Parul Jana rushed to the appellant in grave anxiety and informed him that they failed to get positive information about their mother and they were extremely worried. They, therefore, requested the appellant to extend his helping hand to get proper information about the health of their mother. The appellant advised them to go to the Refinery Hospital. Since the Refinery Hospital, Haldia had referred the case of Parul Jana to Apollo Hospital, Madras, they would be able to get information from Haldia Hospital. Sons of Parul Jana requested the appellant to accompany them to the hospital. The appellant being an employee and well-known for his work in the hospital, could not refuse the reasonable request of two persons and accordingly accompanied them. On reaching the hospital, they found the office of the Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Bhattacharya, open and he was also available. According to the appellant, two sons of Parul Jana approached Dr. Bhattacharya and requested him to give information about their mother who was ailing and admitted to Apollo Hospital, Madras. Dr. Bhattacharya said nothing in spite of repeated requests by sons of Parul Jana. On the contrary, Dr. Bhattacharya without any reason, flared up and told them that he was not supposed to provide information about Parul Jana to anyone and everyone. When sons of Parul Jana insisted to have information from Dr. Bhattacharya, the latter told them that they should not worry about their mother and in the event of her death, the Corporation would arrange to bring the dead body from Apollo Hospital, Madras to Haldia and the body would be handed over to the sons. According to the appellant, he continued to be a silent spectator all throughout. Sons of Parul Jana were seriously shocked and disturbed on such statement being made and they raised objection against the behaviour of Dr. Bhattacharya. Dr. Bhattacharya called several persons in the hospital and directed them to throw all persons including the appellant out of the hospital premises. Sons of Parul Jana could not control themselves. The appellant was also not spared. Being a heart patient and already had undergone heart surgery, he was very much upset as outsiders brought by Dr. Bhattacharya started pushing and dragging the persons including the appellant and sons of Parul Jana out of the hospital. The appellant was bewildered and motionless for some time. The appellant apprehended that Dr. Bhattacharya would create a situation which may adversely affect appellant's health. There was heated exchange of words which resulted in commotion. There was scuffle on the arrival of outsiders and two sons of Parul Jana out of hospital premises. The appellant immediately contacted the General Manager (Projects) and requested him to help to control the situation. When the General Manager reached the hospital, the appellant explained the situation to him. The General Manager also met Dr. Bhattacharya to get true and correct facts as to how the incident had happened. The General Manager then advised the appellant to go back. Immediately, the appellant left the hospital. In the entire incident, asserted the appellant, save and except accompanying sons of Parul Jana, he did nothing. He was not involved in the incident in any manner whatsoever. It was the Chief Medical Officer, who alone was responsible for the entire unfortunate situation. He also inflicted injuries on two sons of Parul Jana. Dr. Bhattacharya, however, cooked up a false case against the appellant alleging that the appellant had assaulted and injured him. On 6th May, 1999, i.e. on the next day, the Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Bhattacharya reported to the management that at the late night hours of 5th May, 1999, the appellant led by a bunch of hooligans had visited the hospital, assaulted him, i.e. Dr. Bhattacharya and abused and threatened other officers. On the basis of the said complaint, on the same day, i.e. , on 6th May, 1999, the General Manager of the Corporation dismissed the appellant for allegedly assaulting the Chief Medical Officer. No notice was issued, no explanation was sought, no charge sheet was filed, no disciplinary enquiry was instituted and no opportunity of hearing was afforded to the appellant. It was stated that in the interest of security of Refinery, the General Manager had to take firm action immediately.
