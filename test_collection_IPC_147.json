The fact that said Kamla had a affair with the appellant would not, in any manner, give any right to the appellant to forcibly take her away from her lawful guardianship. In this background the Trial Court correctly came to the conclusion that the appellant was guilty of the offences for which he is convicted and the said conviction, in our opinion, deserves to be sustained.

The First Information Report was lodged by Ramgopal Chipa, PW1, who was present at the place of occurrence when the incident took place. The prosecution story is that on 30th September, 1979 Meharban Singh, A1 invited Prakash(deceased), Ram Gopal, PW1 and Narayan, PW5 for dinner in connection with the last rite (thirteenth day) ceremony of his father. While Prakash and Ram Gopal, PW1 were on their way to the house of Meharban Singh, A1, they met Narayan, PW5 who was also going to the house of Meharban Singh, in the same connection. A2 to A7 had also come to the house of Meharbansingh to attend the thirteenth day ceremony. Meharban Singh, A1 introduced Prakash with the other accused persons. Thereafter Prakash(deceased), Ram Gopal, PW1 and Narayan, PW5 started eating the food served to them sitting in the Varandah(Paur) where a lantern was burning. The accused persons were sitting on a cot. They were smoking bidis and were whispering amongst themselves. When they had taken half of their meals, they heard gun fire from outside and in that process the lantern was extinguished. Realizing the danger Prakash(deceased), Ram Gopal, PW1 and Narayan, PW5 tried to run away. They heard the accused saying \"pakdo pakdo\". Prakash(deceased), Ram Gopal, PW1 and Narayan, PW5 somehow managed to come on the road and tried to escape through the Gali, which goes towards Ram Janki Temple. Prakash(deceased) was caught hold by the accused persons who pulled him down. Mahendra Singh, A3 fired at Prakash(deceased) with his country made pistol(Katta). Thereafter Meharban Singh, A1, Pratap Singh, A2 and Mahendra Singh, A3 threw stones aiming at the head of deceased and crushed his head. Hearing Prakash's cries, Uday Bhan Singh, A4, Nawab singh, A5, Nirpat Singh, A6 and Jandel Singh, A7 started throwing stones on Ram gopal, PW1 and Narayan, PW Although there were other houses in the Gali but none of the residents came to their rescue in spite of hue and cry raised by them. Ram Gopal, PW1 went to the police station at Dabra and got the FIR recorded. Hukumsingh Yadav, SHO, Debra Police Station after recording the first information report came to the place of occurrence in the night itself. There is nothing on record to indicate that a copy of FIR was sent to the jurisdictional Magistrate as required under Section 157 of the Cr. P.C. Prosecution case is that the Investigating Officer could not carry on with the investigation at night due to darknesections Early in the morning the next day Panchnama of the dead body was prepared and dead body was sent for post- mortem. Dr. Dharampal katariya, PW3 conducted the post mortem at 00 O'clock the same day. In his opinion, Prakash died due to damage to the vital organ i.e. brain. That the injuries caused on the head of the deceased were sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature. It has come in the evidence that the only persons invited for the thirteenth day ceremony were the ones with whom the accused persons had long standing litigation both criminal and civil. Meharban singh, A1 had a dispute with the deceased regarding a piece of land. Similarly he had litigation with Narayan, PW The criminal litigation between them was also pending. According to PW5 no other person had been invited except the three of them. It is unlikely that a person would go and invite the persons with whom he is at logger heads for dinner to his house or for that matter the persons so invited would even accept the invitation and come for dinner. Neither the deceased nor any of the eye witnesses had ever visited the house of any of the accused persons earlier. From the prosecution story put forth it is evident that the intention, if at all, was to kill Prakash(deceased) only. It is unlikely that the two eye witnesses would also be invited along with the deceased. The accused would not invite the other two persons to become eye witnesses of the occurrence. Deceased belongs to village Dabra. PW1 belongs to village Jangipura and PW5 belongs to village Kheri. PW1 belongs to Chipa caste whereas PW5 belongs to kuchvadiya caste which deals the business of sale and purchase of hair and skins of cattles. To show their presence at the spot they had stated that they received injuries at the time of occurrence but this fact is not supported by the medical evidence. PW1 asserted that Jandel Singh, A7 was brother in law of Meharban Singh. PW5 in his deposition contradicted PW1 and stated that no sister of Meharban singh was married to Jandel Singh, A PW1 in his deposition in the court stated that all the seven accused had caused injury to the deceased with stones whereas in his statement before the police he had mentioned that only A1 Meharban singh, and A2 Pratap Singh, who had caused injuries on the head of the deceased. PW5 in the court stated that all the seven accused had caused injuries to the deceased with stones whereas in his statement before the police he had stated that A1 Meharban Singh alone had caused the said injuries. PW1 and PW5 were duly confronted with their statements made before the police. They were unable to satisfactorily explain this vital contradiction. They have made vital improvement in their statements in the court to implicate the other accused persons as well and in any case the possibility of their doing so cannot be ruled out because of their animosity towards the accused persons. Investigating Officer reached the spot at about 00p.m. He did not carry the investigation further at night due to darknesections He did not make any effort to search for the accused though their houses were a few steps away from the place of occurrence. It is unbelievable that an Investigating Officer who is going for the investigation of a murder case at night would not carry a torch with him or try to procure some other source of light to carry on with the investigation. There were houses all around and could have easily arranged for some light. He had gone there in a jeep and if no other source of light was available he could have at least made search for the accused persons with the help of the headlights of the jeep. He did not send a copy of the first information report to the jurisdictional Magistrate. He kept silent as to what time the first information report was dispatched or received by the jurisdictional Magistrate.

The accused persons passed by his side and reached the place where the three persons including Gopikrishna were chit-chatting. The accused persons were armed with naked weapons such as swords, choppers and gupti. As soon as they reached near Gopikrishna they opened an assault on all the three persons standing there. Jaideep and Dyandeo ran away from the place. Gopikrishna tried to escape for his life by running towards the door providing access to the staircase leading to upper floors of the building. He went on running upto the fourth floor leaving a trail of blood behind. The accused persons chased him and injured him fatally. He fell down in a pool of blood on the landing of the fourth floor. Sanjay, PW1 apprehended that he may be assaulted and injured. He tried to run away from the place of the incident. He was noticed by the appellants; some of them followed him and inflicted injuries on his person. The appellants then shouted loudly so as to create terror in the locality.

He came to his house along with his family members and later on took their dinner. His father, Brahmdeo Raut (PW-5), and his brother came out of their house and started going to Bathan. As soon as they reached mid-way from Bathan suddenly Bunnilal Chaudhary (A-1), Birendra Chaudhary (A-2), Maniraj Chaudhary (A-3), Dashrath Chaudhary (A-4), Magister Chaudhary (A-5), Bali Choudhary (A-6), Jagdish Chaudhary (A-7), Amarjit Chaudhary (A-8), Naresh Choudhary (A-9) and Rajdhari Chaudhary (A-10) holding a revolver and lathis in their hands came at the scene of occurrence and surrounded them. His younger brother, Shambhu Raut, reached there and all the accused persons chased him upto some distance when Bunnilal Choudhary (A-1) attacked Shambhu Raut with knife at the door of Ambika Ram. The blow was given on the left side of the chest. On seeing the incident, his father, Brahmdeo Raut (P.W.-5), came running to the house of Ambika Ram. His father was given knife blow on his head by Magister Chaudhary (A-5). On hearing their noise, many village people gathered at the scene of occurrence and on seeing them, all the accused persons fled away. His brother, Shambhu Raut, being seriously injured fell down at the door of Ambika Ram and blood was oozing out of the injury sustained by him. Shambhu Raut who was injured was put on a cot and taken to Sidhwalia Hospital for medical treatment where the Doctor had declared him dead. He took the dead- body of Shambhu Raut to the Police Station.

STATE OF RAJASTHAN [2014] INSC 133 (26 February 2014)  The case of the prosecution in brief is as follows : PW 7 Shera Ram is the younger brother of deceased Shivji Ram and they had obtained land from Gram Panchayat towards the western side of the village and obtained Pattas for the said land.  Accused Bhera Ram and accused Chuna Ram are real brothers while accused Surja Ram and accused Mohan Ram are sons of accused Sadula Ram.  Accused Bhera Ram and Sadula Ram told Shivji Ram and Shera Ram that they will not allow them to take the land and will snatch it from them.  Two months prior to occurrence Shivji Ram and Shera Ram erected fencing around their land whereupon the accused Bhera Ram and other accused were seriously annoyed over the same.  On the occurrence day i.e. on 29.5.1983 at 10.30 a.m. Shivji Ram and both his younger brothers were repairing/re-erecting the fencing in their land, accused persons Bhera Ram, Sadula Ram and his sons Mohan Ram and Surja Ram, Gordhan Ram, Nanak Ram and Chuna Ram, all duly armed entered into Bara from south side and started dismantling the fence.  Shivji Ram and his brothers questioned the same by saying that they have obtained Patta from the Panchayat.  Thereupon Bhera Ram and Surja Ram simultaneously inflicted Barchhi blow on the head of Shivji Ram, as a result of which he fell down and all the accused attacked him with their weapons.  Shera Ram intervened and accused Mohan Ram inflicted Barchhi blow which landed on the left side of his head and accused Chuna Ram inflicted the jei blow on his right leg.  Then all the accused started beating whereupon his sister Dhuri came running and fell upon Shera Ram in order to protect him.

Sukhpal was a Major and the other four appellants were constables of the Special Armed Force (S.A.F), Gwalior and at the material time they were camping at Chhatarpur to look after the law and order situation there. At the time of her health Phoola Devi was a member of the Janpad Panchayat and Gram Panchayat and was a social worker of the same area. According to the prosecution the appellants used to indulge in anti-social activities and were responsible for gambling and illicit distillation. As their such activities had created a terror among the villagers Phoola Devi took up the cudgels against them. On August 1982 the Company Commandant of sectionA.F. was to visit the village and Phoola Devi had planned to submit a representation to him complaining about the illegal activities of the appellants. This visit was, however, cancelled. It is alleged that the appellants had learnt about such move of Phoola Devi. The further prosecution case is that on September 17, 1982 at or about 8 A.M. the appellants entered into the house of Phoola Devi on the pretext that they had information that she was having in her possession contraband qanja and unlicensed pistol. Phoola Devi was, however, not in the house at that time and her nephew told them that there was no such material. In the meantime Phoola Devi came back home and denied the accusation levelled against her. Appellant Sukhpal then abused her and appellant Ramrup Singh caught hold of her hair and started beating her. She was dragged outside the house and then taken towards the police station. While being taken to the police station, the appellants continued to beat her with lathis and a Beshram stick. At the police station they let her go on an assurance that she would pay rs. 150/- and would not lodge any complaint. Phoola Devi, however, went to Chhatarpur and lodged a complaint on September 18, She was then sent for medical examination by Dr. Thereafter Phoola Devi left the village out of fear and went to the nearby town of Banda (Uttar Pradesh) where she died on September 23, 1982. The appellants completely denied the charges levelled against them. Their contention was that on September 17, 1982 an unlicensed pistol was recovered from the possession of Phoola Devi and hence they brought her to the police station. She however managed to run away from there and they did not know how she met with her death later on. According to the appellants she used to manufacture illicit liquor with the connivance and assistance of Devi Dayal (P.W.1), Dasharath Prasad (P.W.2) and Baby (P.W.3) and others and they were falsely implicated in the case at their instance. To sustain the charges levelled against the appellants the prosecution examined Devi Dayal (P.W.1), Dasharath Prasad (P.W.2) and Babu (P.W.3) as eye- witnesses, besides two doctors and the Investigating Officer.", "statute": ["s1"]}, "2009.INSC.1426.txt": {"doc_url": "http://www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/2009/1426.html", "explanation": {"It is alleged that the appellant along with his brother-in-law and uncle came to the place where the complainant was residing and started beating 3 him and thereafter set fire to the hut.": ["s1"], "On account of commission of offence of mischief by fire the entire hut along with the household articles were burnt and reduced into ashes.": ["s1"], "The appellant along with other persons ran away from the spot.": ["s1"], "It is brought to our notice that during the pendency of the appeal in the High Court complainant - Sitaram died in the year That because of initiation of criminal case against the appellant there were some ill-feelings between the appellant and the widow of the complainant - Malti Devi aged 61 years.": ["s1"], "It is evident from the record that the appellant is a young married man having small kids and he is the only earning member of his family.": ["s1"]}, "fact": " The trial court by its judgment and order dated 1991 found the appellant guilty of the offence punishable under Section 436 Indian Penal Code, 1860 and acquitted him of the charge under Section 147 Indian Penal Code, 1860. On appeal, the High Court by its impugned judgment and order dated 2008 in Criminal Appeal no. 775 of 2001 (Old no. 1529/91) dismissed the appeal preferred by the appellant. 3. The occurrence giving rise to the present appeal is said to have occurred on 1989 at about 00 P.M. The case of the prosecution, as deposed to by the complainant-Sita Ram (PW-3) is that he was living along with his wife and children in a hut near Nagla Shiv Temple, P.S. Lalkuan for the last three years preceding the date of occurrence. It is alleged that the appellant along with his brother-in-law and uncle came to the place where the complainant was residing and started beating 3 him and thereafter set fire to the hut. On account of commission of offence of mischief by fire the entire hut along with the household articles were burnt and reduced into ashes. The appellant along with other persons ran away from the spot. It is the further case of the prosecution that Sitaram reported the details of the incident vide Exhibit KA-1 on the same day at about 00 P.M.Based on Exhibit KA-I the Police Station Lalkuan, District Nainital registered a case under Sections 436 and 323 Indian Penal Code, 1860 against the appellant. 4. The police having completed the investigation, filed charge sheet against the appellant. The prosecution in order to establish its case against the appellant and another altogether examined 5 witnesses (PW-1 to PW-5). The statement under Section 313 Cr. P.C. of the appellant was recorded in which he stated that due to prior enmity he has been falsely implicated in the case. It is brought to our notice that during the pendency of the appeal in the High Court complainant - Sitaram died in the year That because of initiation of criminal case against the appellant there were some ill-feelings between the appellant and the widow of the complainant - Malti Devi aged 61 years. In order to live in peace and tranquility the appellant and Malti Devi entered into a compromise at the intervention of local elders whereunder an amount of rs. 1 lakh was given by the appellant to the widow as a solatium. That ever since the compromise, parties are living in peace and maintaining very cordial relations with each other. 5 7. The wife of deceased Sitaram filed Crl. M.P no. 12467 of 2009 to implead herself as party respondent in this appeal in which the facts stated above are depicted for consideration of this Court. The learned counsel submitted that in view of the subsequent developments the sentence imposed upon the appellant may be reduced to that of the sentence already undergone. Be that as it may, we cannot compound the offence on the basis of the said compromise inasmuch as the offence punishable under Section 436 Indian Penal Code, 1860 is non- compoundable nor we can direct the courts below to compound the offence based on the compromise. 8. It is evident from the record that the appellant is a young married man having small kids and he is the only earning member of his family. The incident is of the year He was in jail for a period of more than 7 months. Considering the nature of allegations leveled against the appellant and considering the period of sentence already undergone and the subsequent developments referred to herein above, we are of the considered opinion that interest of justice would be met by 6 maintaining the conviction of the appellant under Section 436 Indian Penal Code, 1860 and reducing the sentence to that of the period already undergone by him. He shall be forthwith released unless required in any other case. 9. The appeal is accordingly partly allowed. J. ( R.V. Raveendran) .J. (B.

["s1"], "In the background of the defence, as set up by the accused, it was incumbent on the part of the prosecution, to have explained the injuries sustained by the accused.": ["s1"]}, "fact": " The apple of discord, as revealed by the prosecution story, was over a trivial matter about the passing of bullock-cart. The bullock-cart of Babulal (PW-1) being driven by his servant Patiram (PW-3) was stopped by the accused in front of the house of Mishrilal (since deceased). Babulal, thereafter, reversed the bullock-cart, brought back his bullock-cart and reached his house by another route. At that time Maharaj Singh (PW-2), uncle of Babulal (PW-1), Bhavarsingh (the deceased), grand-father of Babulal and Gopal (PW-7) and others were sitting in front of the house of Babulal, who questioned as to why the bullock-cart had to be brought back by different route and at this Babulal narrated to them the story of stoppage of bullock-cart by the respondents. At this moment, accused Mishrilal armed with a Farsi, Jamunaprasad armed with a twelve bore gun, accused Ashok Kumar with a desi Katta and rest of the accused-persons having lathis with them came near the house of Babulal hurling abuses, followed by heated exchange of words between both the sides. Then all of a sudden Jamunaprasad fired a gunshot at Babulal. The pellets hit him in his legs. The deceased Bhavarsingh, grandfather of Babulal tried to save him and stood in front of Babulal, when accused Ashok Kumar fired at him with the desi Katta hitting him on the chest. The deceased fell down on the ground and become unconscious. PW-2 Maharaj Singh and Karan Singh PW-4 also came to save Babulal but accused Jamunaprasad fired again hitting Maharaj Singh and Karan Singh. Accused Madhusudan assaulted Babulal by the lathi hitting him on the right shoulder. On raising hue and cry, the accused fled away. The deceased Bhavarsingh was taken to Kannaud Hospital where he was declared dead. Injured Babulal, Maharaj Singh and Karan Singh were admitted in the hospital and treated. Dr. G.D. Kashyap (PW-6), sent intimation to Police Station, Karnnod. ASI Dharamraj Singh (PW-17) reached the hospital and on being reported by Babulal (PW-1) ASI registered the FIR (Ex. P-1). The police issued the requisition form of all the injured persons marked as (Exs. P-30, P-31 and P-32). Thereafter, the police case (Ex. P-33) was registered on the basis of (Ex. P-1). The post-mortem was conducted by PW-6 embodying \"the cause of death is from gunshot wound and its mode is syncope\". The post-mortem report is (Ex. P-6). The injury reports in respect of Babulal, Karan Singh and Maharaj Singh are marked as (Exs. P-7, P-11 and P-12). X-ray plates with regard to injuries sustained by Babulal and Maharaj Singh are marked as (Exs. P-8 to P-10 and P-13 to P-16) respectively. The investigating officer also prepared a spot map (Ex. P-3). In the instant case, the investigating officer submitted the challan against both the parties. GENESIS OF OCCURRENCE As already noticed, the apple of discord is passing of the bullock-cart belonging to PW-1 Babulal, in front of the house of the accused Mishrilal. It is in the evidence on record that the bullock-cart of accused Mishrilal was parked in the gali impeding the passage of bullock-cart of Babulal PW. In the circumstances Babulal was asked to stop the bullock- cart which had to be reversed and taken from the other route. PW-1 naturally took it as an insult and felt bad and on being arrived at his place where Maharaj Singh, Bhavarsingh etc. were sitting and on being questioned about the change in the route, he narrated the incident of stoppage to the members of his family. In such a situation, it is expected that they have reasons to raise grievances. Whereas the accused party being succeeded in getting the bullock-cart diverted, were victorious and there was no reason to revolt by following Babulal armed with farsi, gun and desi katta and lathis as alleged by the prosecution. This allegation is clearly against the logic. It is logically improbable that the accused being able to stop and compel the bullock-cart to retreat would have still opted to follow Babulal and initiate a quarrel. It is logically improbable and unbelievable in the ordinary course of human conduct because the grievance of the accused, if any, has been redressed by preventing the bullock-cart to pass through the passage and accomplish in retreating the bullock-cart through another route, would still follow the prosecution party and assault them in front of their house. They have no reason to be annoyed or unhappy which would compel them to go to the house of the prosecution party and took up a quarrel with them. In the evidence on record it is shown that the cartridges were found in front of the house of PW-8 and blood stained earth was seized from the wall of the house of PW- But in spot map (Ex. P-3) the position shown is contrary and the house of PW-8 was omitted from this map. The testimony of Ramnarayan (PW-8) is inconsistent with (Ex. P-3) spot map. The prosecution party and not the complainant party were the aggressors, is further made amply clear in the depositions of PWs 1 and PW-1 Babulal stated in para 9 of the statement as under:- \"All of them stood in front of my cart and they did not cry lowdly and they used to tell only this that no cart will go from here and please do not take away cart via this route. All of them prevented my cart on the high way, for which I took bad. \" Babulal further stated as under: \"Then I stated to my grandfather that all of these were not allowing to bring my bullock cart from this side I stated while rebuking that these mather chodon are not allowing to take out the bullock cart then Maharaj Singh and Bhawar Singh stated that we will make them understand and then they remained stand there. \" PW-2 Maharaj Singh also stated as under:- \"This is correct that Babu had stated this that salone did not allow the cart to came out through the high way and due to this fact we took it ill. \" From the facts and circumstances, as adumbrated above, it is amply clear that the prosecution party was the aggressor and the alleged incident did not happen in front of the house of the prosecution party, rather the prosecution party took offence to the stoppage of bullock-cart of Babulal, but the prosecution has suppressed the genesis and origin of the occurrence. We are clearly of the view, therefore, that the prosecution party was an aggressor. PRESENCE OF ACCUSED ASHOK KUMAR AT THE PLACE OF OCCURRENCE Accused Ashok Kumar was attributed of firing with desi katta at the chest of the deceased Bhavarsingh which appears to have proved fatal. In the instant case, the prosecution party went straight to the hospital from the place of incident. Accused Ashok Kumar, from the very beginning of the trial, took a defence that he was not present at the spot on the day of incident and he has been falsely implicated on the ground that Ashok Kumar was having some love affair with Suganbai, the sister of PW-7 Gopal. Accused Ashok Kumar sustained no injury. PW-7 Gopal is undisputedly a member of the family of a complainant party and in this background falsely implicating Ashok Kumar as an accused cannot be ruled out. As noticed earlier, in exhibitP-29 there was no mention of an attack by a desi katta. The necessary implication is that the name of Ashok Kumar and katta were introduced only after arrival of the police (PW-17) and after deliberation. Further, in exhibitP-29 only gun was mentioned. Against Ashok Kumar one of the eyewitness account is given by PW-5 Chagan. He was unable to say as from where katta was taken out. The alleged eyewitness account of PW-5 Chagan is also not acceptable because the name of PW-5 was not mentioned in exhibit P- His name also appears to have been introduced after the arrival of PW-17 and after deliberation. The alleged disclosure and recovery of exhibitP-20 and seizure memo exhibitP-21 both prepared by one V.K. Silawat, Station House Officer of Police Station, was not examined in the case. PW-9 Babulal - punch witness, father of PW-5, did not prove the material recited in exhibitP- PW- 12 Lakhanlal - another punch witness, also did not testify the material recited in exhibitP- The prosecution has also failed to prove that the desi katta was in exclusive possession of the accused Ashok Kumar. This all goes to show that the facts of seizure are not free from doubt. All the more so, when the prosecution tried to suppress the genesis and the origin of the occurrence. There is no guarantee that they are speaking the truth with regard to the facts of seizure exhibitP- As already noticed, accused Ashok Kumar was attributed of hitting on the chest of the deceased by desi katta. Dr. G.D. Kashyap (PW-6) conducted the post-mortem. He found the following external injuries:- \"External Injuries: (1) Gunshot (Firearm) wound. (A) wound of entry size (irregular round shape) 2\"x2\"x18\" on the front Right chest 4\" above the right (Illeg. ) when a probe inserted in this wound it comes out on posterior side on wound of exit. Direction the wound is medialy Back wounds and downwords (B) wound of exit Gun shot size 2 \" x2\"x18\" situated 1\" Rt. Lateral to 10th Thoracic vertebra, Direction lateraly (Illeg. ) and upwords. It is continuous to the wound of entry. The edges of both wounds are irregular oral shape. But edges of entrance wound in inverted and edges of exit wound is everted. Both the wounds are antemortem wounds. From both these wounds oozing of blood is too much. The doctor also found irregular shaped six small chharas stained with blood from the right chest of the deceased. From the post-mortem report as noticed, PW-6 described the injuries as gunshot and not from the pistol. The prosecution has failed to obtain the opinion of ballistic expert. The prosecution also did not explain as to whether in desi katta 12 bore cartridges can also be fired. In the absence of explanation by the prosecution, it is difficult to accept that in desi katta 12 bore cartridges can be fired in the instant case. In the present case, a doubt has been created as to whether a desi katta can also fire 12 bore cartridges, which has not been explained by the prosecution. As already noticed, Ashok Kumar did not sustain any injuries on his body. In the ordinary course of human conduct, when his father Mishrilal is inflicted as many as five injuries which are stated to be dangerous to life, a son is expected to intervene in order to salvage his father and in the process he would receive injuries on his body, if he was present at the place of occurrence. In the FIR.(Ex. D-8) lodged by Mishrilal also, the presence of Ashok at the place of occurrence was not mentioned. COMMON OBJECT We have noticed that in exhibitP-1 accused Mishrilal, Jamunaprasad, Madhusudan and Ashok Kumar have been mentioned, but the remaining five accused Radhakishan, Vinod Kumar, Hukumchand, Jagdish and Rajendrakumar were not mentioned. It is also in the evidence on record that five accused were standing at the back and did not participate. In the exhibitP-1 itself, it is stated that others were having lathis. Who were the others and who were having lathis, has not been described in the complaint. It is in the evidence of PWs 1 and 2 that they were standing behind at a short distance. No participation of each of the accused, overt act or otherwise, has been attributed to them. They could be passive onlookers. It is difficult to accept that they were members of unlawful assembly and the offence was committed in prosecution of common object of that assembly. Their conviction with the aid of Section 149 is, thus, clearly impermissible. Their conviction under Section 148 would also go. As already noticed, Mishrilal, Madhusudan and Jamunaprasad received injuries in the incident. According to Dr. G.D. Kashyap (PW-6) the injuries sustained by Madhusudan and Jamunaprasad were simple in nature, while the injuries found on the person of Mishrilal would be dangerous to life being on the sensitive part of the body - head. Accused Mishrilal received as many as five injuries - one incised wound and one lacerated wound on vital part like head. The doctor opined that the injuries were dangerous to life. The other three accused were all the sons of Mishrilal. We have doubted the presence of accused - Ashok Kumar at the place of incident. The remaining two sons Madhusudan and Jamunaprasad received injuries on their bodies. In the ordinary course of human conduct, if the father receives as many as five injuries in the presence of sons, the sons are not expected to be moot spectators. Firing from 12 bore gun is attributed to accused Jamunaprasad, the pellets of which hit the legs of Babulal PW-1 causing injuries which were simple in nature. Since we have already held that the prosecution party was the aggressor, we do not think that accused Jamunaprasad has exceeded the right of private defence. The fact that PW-1 Babulal received the bullet injuries on his legs would clearly show that Jamunaprasad fired from 12 bore gun to free his father and themselves from the clutches of the accused. One should not forget that Mishrilal has received as many as five injuries which were dangerous to life and the accused Jamunaprasad at that time reasonably apprehending the danger to the life of his father had fired the gunshot at that point of time in self-defence, which is quite justified. As already said, accused Mishrilal received as many as five injuries, which were dangerous to life. Madusudan and Jamunanprasad received simple injuries. In exhibitP-1 as well as in the entire deposition of PWs, the prosecution has not explained the injuries sustained by the accused. In the background of the defence, as set up by the accused, it was incumbent on the part of the prosecution, to have explained the injuries sustained by the accused. The omission on the part of the prosecution to explain the injuries on the person of the accused assumes much greater importance where the evidence consists of interested or inimical witnesses or where the defence gives a version which competes in probability with that of the prosecution one. None of the prosecution witnesses explained the injuries sustained by the accused. The injuries sustained by Mishrilal were dangerous to life. The prosecution witnesses consist of interested and inimical witnesses. We are, therefore, of the view that the prosecution has not presented the true version on most material part of the story. Their evidential value does not inspire confidence and it cannot be accepted on its face value and relied upon.", "statute": ["s1"]}, "2009.INSC.1638.txt": {"doc_url": "http://www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/2009/1638.html", "explanation": {"persons from rival party (PWP) have assaulted the persons from their party and, that arrangements be made in sending the Police Party.": ["s1"], "PW-18 was informed that one of the injured persons viz., Suresh Atmaram Gharat was dead.": ["s3"]}, "fact": " ##  PANDURANG CHANDRAKANT MHATRE & ORS. v.

STATE OF U.P. [2011] INSC 73 (25 January 2011)  The origin of the prosecution case lies in an altercation between the accused and one Kaldhari (PW 1) alleged to have taken place two days prior to the date of incident on 23rd December, 1979.  It is the case of the prosecution that one Ramdhani (not examined) in partnership with Kaldhari (PW 1) had obtained lease of fishery rights in respect of a pond situated in Harirampur village.  They had raised fish in the said pond.  The accused were claiming right to collect fish from the said pond.  Kaldhari (PW 1) along with his 3 companions had gone to village Harirampur for the collection of the fish from the pond.  The accused along with their associates had also assembled there to collect the fish from the pond.  Their attempts were resisted by Kaldhari (PW 1) resulting in an altercation.  Awadhoo (A 1), since deceased, threatened Kaldhari (PW 1) of his life.  This incident had taken place in the presence of Madan (PW 4) and one Sidhu (not examined).  It is further the case of the prosecution that on 24th December, 1979 at about 10.30 p.m. in the night while Kaldhari (PW 1) was sleeping in his house with its door bolted from inside, his father Abhi Raj (deceased) and nephew Bal Kishun (deceased) were sleeping on a takhat in the verandah, all of a sudden, Abhi Raj and Bal Kishun (both deceased) raised alarm and in the meanwhile, someone started thumping on the door of the room where Kaldhari (PW 1) was sleeping.  As he was about to open the door, he could hear Awadhoo (A 1) commanding him to open the door.  Kaldhari (PW 1) identified him from his 4 voice.  Kaldhari then started raising alarm from inside the house.  This attracted Sonai (PW 3), Sheo Kumar (PW 2) and Lal Mani (not examined) from the neighbourhood who reached the place of occurrence flashing torch lights.  On seeing the witnesses, Kaldhari gathered courage and opened the door of his room and came into verandah.   He saw that all the four accused accompanied by two or three unknown associates were assaulting his father Abhi Raj and nephew Bal Kishun with knives and bhalas.   On finding that the villagers were gathering at the scene of offence, the miscreants retreated and before turning away from the place of occurrence, they also opened fire.  The police station,as per chik FIR is about 20 kilometers away from the place of occurrence.

The deceased was running a fancy shop and wine shop in bagole village. He was also a member of Panchayat. A-1 to A-4 are also residents of the same village where A-1 was having a cloth shop adjacent to that of the fancy shop of the deceased. A-1 was also a Sarpanch of the Village and there were political rivalries between the deceased and A-1, A-2 is the son-in-law of A-1 and A-3 is nephew of A-According to the prosecution, prior to the occurrence in question, there were certain incidents on account of which certain criminal case was pending against the deceased due to which there was enmity between them. This apart, the A-1 was indulging in cotton market gambling and the deceased made complaints to the police and the Police began to keep watch on the activities of A-1 and hence A-1 was having grudge against the deceased. It is said that since A-1 to A-8 entertained grudge against the deceased, they issued threats to his life. On the date and time of the occurrence, the brothers (P.W.2) of the deceased had closed the shop while the deceased was standing in front of his shop along with his clerk. At that point of time, P.W.s 5, 8 and 9 arrived there. The deceased was talking to them and when they proceeded, P.W.G. arrived there and when they were busy in talking, A-1 to A-3 along with three other persons emerged from behind a lorry standing there and on the instigation of A-1, A-2, and A-3 hurled bombs at the deceased. The bomb hurled by A-2 hit the deceased on his back and exploded. The hurled by A-3 fell near deceased and exploded. The deceased fell down and died instantaneously. The further prosecution case is that Vijaysena Reddy, P.W.I. , the younger brother of the deceased opened the shop, dictated a report to his another brother Valmati Parandham Reddy, P.W-2, and took it to the police Station, Bitrangunta, where he lodged a written report (Exh. P-2) at about 30 PM on Inspector, P.W. The police Inspector, P.W.20 recorded the statements of some of the witnesses during the night and statement of others were recorded next morning. An inquest P-25 was prepared between 7 to 9 A.M. next day. Dr. M. Venkataratnamma, P.W. 1G performed an autopsy on the dead body of the deceased, who as per his post mortem report, Exh. P-6, found a single injury on the person of the deceased which is a follows : \"A quadrangular, lacerated, burnt injury in between both the scapular region, measuring about '9' to 10 in length, in all sides. The depth of the wound is about 3\" in the middle upto the spinal column, the depth of wound is about 4\" to 5\", upto the lungs and heart. Both the lungs and posterior surface of the heart, in its lower portion are charred. The is charred, at its lower portion of muscles extends upto the middle of the back, that is 10th thoracic Vertebrae. The posterior portions of the Vertebrae from 1st to 10th are broken and burnt, exposing the spinal column. Spinal cord is also damaged. Ribs from 2nd to 8th on either side were broken and charred. All the muscles are charred in the middle of the wound, and deeply cancerated, peripherally. The surrounding skin is blackish. about 2\" to 3\" all round the wound\". In the opinion of the doctor, the deceased died to shock and massive destruction of the tissues and the spinal cord as result of burn injury. In the opinion of the doctor, death could be instantaneous as the injury was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature of cause death. It is true that it appears that the report ex. P-2 lodged by P.W.I. was prepared after deliberations. The incident had occurred between 8 to 30 P.M. while this report was dictated by P.W.I in the shop and lodged at about 30 P.M. after two hours though the police station is situated close- by at a distance less than one mile. In the case diary statement of P.W.G, who is the star witness of the prosecution, the presence of P.Ws 1 and 2 at the place of occurrence has not been mentioned. It is just possible that two brothers of deceased, P.Ws 1 and 2 arrived later at the place of scene after getting information of the occurrence which resulted into late reporting to the police. The presence of P.Ws 1 and 2, therefore, becomes highly doubtful at the place and time of occurrence. We have examined the evidence of P.Ws. 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 and P.W.4, as said earlier, is the paternal uncle of the deceased who is also having a shop in the same vicinity where the incident had occurred and therefore his presence at the place of occurrence cannot be doubted. He categorically stated that after closing his shop at about 8 PM he went to the centre and saw the deceased talking to P.W.G. in front of his shop and it was at that point of time that A-1, A-2 and A-3 along with two others were seen going towards the lorry standing near the shop of the deceased. He further deposed that A-1 to A-9 and three other accused went behind the deceased and A-1 exhorted to hurl bombs at which A-2 and A-3 hurled the bombs at the deceased. The bomb hurled by A-2 hit the deceased at his back and the bomb hurled by A-3 fell near him and exploded. Similar is the evidence of P.W.G. who deposed that he was working as steam-man in the Loop-shed Bitrangunta and was going to his duty and had reached the place of occurrence where he saw the deceased talking to P.W.s 5, 8, and 9 when they proceeded ahead, the deceased accosted him and started talking to him. It was shortly thereafter that A-1 to A-3 along with three other persons emerged from behind the lorry and on the instigation of A-1, A-2 threw a bomb which hit the deceased on his back and A-8 also threw a bomb which hit the deceased which fell near the deceased and exploded. The statement of A-4 is thus corroborated by the evidence of an independent witness P.W.G. The note of caution sounded for accepting the evidence of a relative witness is that it should be subjected to careful and close scrutiny and if such a witness stood the test of careful and close scrutiny, there is no reason not to accept his testimony. In the present case we find that evidence of P.W.4 not only with- stood the said test but is also corroborated by the evidence of an independent witness P.W.G. But the fact cannot be lost sight of that the first bomb had hit the deceased. There was hardly any occasion for the first bomb to hit P.W.G. as he covered by the body of the deceased. The bomb particles would have gone side-ways. The second bomb which fell by the side of the deceased also exploded and emitted smoke. It travelled to some other direction as admittedly, the second bomb had fallen by the side of the deceased but no part of it hit even the deceased. It is therefore, difficult to accept that since no injury was caused to P.W.G. by the second bomb, his presence becomes doubtful. The presence of P.W.G. at the place of occurrences is testified by the independent witnesses, namely, P.Ws. 5, 8, 9 there is no reason to disbelieve their the consistent evidence of P.Ws. 4 and 8 coupled with the evidence of P.Ws 5, 8 and 9 coupled with the evidence of P.Ws 5, 8, 9 as well as that of P.W. 10, the implication of the appellants in the crime is fully established. The evidence of P.W.4 has been rejected on the ground that he is an interested witness being an unola of the deceased. It may be noticed that all the eye witnesses have deposed that they first saw the accused persons A-1, to A-3 and three others emerging from behind the lorry stationed near a place of occurrence and on exhortation by A-1 the other accused A-2 and A-3 hurled the bombs. It would be but natural such exhortation would have attracted the attention of witnesses and they would have seen the accused/appellants hurling the bombs. It is common knowledge that the smoke will follow later after the hurled and exploded.", "statute": ["s1"]}, "1997.INSC.870.txt": {"doc_url": "http://www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/1997/870.html", "explanation": {"9 to 14 who have been referred to in the judgment as Pandeys were given benefit of doubt as they were shown as accused on the basis of the only allegation that they were helping and instigating the harijans, accused Nos.": ["s1"], "1 to 9, who had on the date of the incident gone to the field of the informant and the deceased and committed the said offence.": ["s1"], "The said 3 witnesses were in their own field along with the deceased and they were cutting grass when the incident took place.": ["s1"], "Their evidence clearly establishes the fact that they should lease the land as it really belong to Ambika, accused no.": ["s1"], "On being so told, the deceased replied by saying that the land belonged to them and that this dispute was already settled by the Panch and there was Sulahanama in that behalf.": ["s1"], "It was at that item that accused Jwala dn accused Hardeo fired shots from their guns and injured Nanahaku.": ["s1"], "As stated earlier the allegation against those accused was that they had colluded with the harijans, that is, accused Nos.": ["s1"], "1 to 9 and in pursuance of that collusion the said offence was committed.

It is his case that when he heard some \"galata\" he went from his house to the place of incident which was about more than one furlong away from his house. He did not state in his evidence who actually helped him to go to the said place of incident.

The only person who is stated to be a witness to the incident as per the dying declaration Ext. P- 21 is PW-12 who has not spoken anything about the attack by the appellant herein either on the deceased or on PW- It is on consideration of all these facts and also taking into consideration the conflict between the evidence of PW-1 and medical evidence the trial court rejected the evidence of PW- In our opinion, the High Court has not taken into consideration these important facts while accepting the evidence of PW- We are aware of the fact that PW-1 is an injured witness and normally the presence of such a witness at the time of incident can be inferred if the injuries are suffered in the course of same incident. But in the instant case, we are unable to place any reliance on the evidence of PW-1 because on his own admission in the cross- examination because of poor eye sight he was not able to identify all the accused persons.

The evidence of PW-4, as a matter of fact, does not support the prosecution at all because according to him it is A-3 and not A-2 who pierced the head of the deceased with a spear.

During the thrashing season, dust and sound came to be produced because of generation of the flour mill to the disliking of the accused.  The accused Sarvjeet, Durga Prasad and Hari Ram had applied for electric disconnection of the informant before the Electricity Department prior to the present incident in which , the accused Raj Kishore was cited as a witness.  A case under Section 133 of Code was instituted against the informant by the 3 police which came to be decided in favour of the informant.  So, there was a long string of enmity between the two sides.  The present incident occurred in three parts.  At about 7.30 P.M. on 7th July,1978 Subhash- the younger brother of the informant was sitting at his grocer's shop on the crossing in front of the house of Sri Vishwa Nath Pandey, Advocate.  All the accused with 2 or 3 other companions reached there.  Sarvjeet and Om Prakash had bombs in their hands; Jagdish had a gun; Ram Narain had country made pistol; Raj Kishore had a spear.   Durga Prasad had a Pharsa and the remaining accused had lathis.   As soon as they reached the shop of Subhash,accused Sarvjeet and Om Prakash attacked Subhash by means of bombs, Ram Narain by means of country made pistol and Jagdish by means of gun.  Subhash ran for his life and anyhow saved himself but was hurt in his leg in this process.  This occurrence was witnessed by Jagdish Mani, Chandbali Pasi, Brijesh Tiwari and others.  The second part of the incident was that the accused came running to the grocer's shop of the informant at Bhatwalia Crossing in search of Subhash and not finding him there, threw bombs and also fired.   The accused Indrajeet set fire to the shop of the informant which was reduced 4 to ashes.  Mahasarey-brother of the informant, Devi Prasad Pandey, Surendra Prasad, Rajesh Singh and others witnessed this incident.  Then the accused came running to the door of the house of the informant where Guru Prasad the deceased was present.  They inquired from him about Subhash saying that he would not be left alive that day.  Guru Prasad wanted to know as to what the matter was.  But the accused Sarvjeet instigated the remaining accused saying that if Subhash was not available, he (Guru Prasad) should be killed.  Instantaneously, Sarvjeet attacked Guru Prasad Tiwari throwing a bomb and Ram Narain by means of the country made pistol.   Guru Prasad died on the spot.  The incident was witnessed by the informant, Ram Darash Tiwari, Bhagirathi Yadav, Nand Kishore, Hari Prasad and Munni-sister of the informant.  The accused persons then ran away.  At the time of the incident electric light was available at the door of the informant.  This was the third part of the incident.  Leaving the dead body of his father at the door, the informant went to the Police Station, and lodged the F.I.R. resulting in registering of the case.  PW-1 says he reached his house at 7.00 p.m. and G.P. Tiwari was shot dead within 4-5 minutes showing that the first two incidents did not take place at 7.30 p.m.  Injury to Subhash Tiwari is not mentioned in the GD, Ka-11.  Subhash(PW-2) says that occurrence took place at 7.15 p.m. at his grocery shop.  Kumari Munni (PW-4) and Nand Kishore (PW-6) had not told any time to IO.  In exhibit ka-6 copy of the FIR time of occurrence is mentioned as 7.45 p.m.  In exhibit Ka-14 challan of dead body, the time is 7.45 p.m.  In the inquest report there is overwriting about time.  In exhibit ka-6 to ka-9 the letters written for medical examination of injured there is no crime number or sections of crime mentioned.  That according to the written report the only source of light present at the scene of occurrence was that of bulb lighted at the door of the house of informant which was claimed by the prosecution and report was obtained from the Electricity department but even that report was not on record nor any one examined from the Electricity Department to prove the case.  He states that Kumari Munni (PW-4) came out to give clothes to him when the father was killed but PW-4 contradicts him by saying that she came out after hearing the alarms.  He mentioned in FIR that Raj Kishore had spear but in deposition he assigned a gun to him and does not say that anyone else had a spear injury to the deceased was not caused by bomb at all.  PW-1 admits he was ex convict and involved in lot of litigations.  He says he cannot tell the name of person who told him about the first two incident.  He had not seen the clothes of Subhash Tiwari (PW-2) nor did he know of the injury of D.P. Pandey (PW-5) yet he mentions these facts in the written report.  He says that accused came looking for Subhash and not finding him killed the father but none of them tried to harm him or other members of family.  Kumari Munni (PW-4) changes her story about coming out of the house on alarm being raised.  She admits that her mother and other ladies did not come out of the house which is strange.  She claims that witnesses had come before the arrival of the accused which is against prosecution story.  12 Nand Kishore (PW-6) is a neighbour.  He claims he was at his door when he heard alarms and on reaching the scene he saw the accused were inquiring Subhash and then hurled bomb and then fired on the deceased.  This is contrary to the versions of PW-1 and PW-4 according to whom witnesses were already there.  He has his own enmity with the accused.  He says that he stood at north western side of the house but did not go to the door of Brij Raj Tiwari but in his statement he says he went to the door of Brij Raj Tiwari.  He says that deceased went a little on the western side after being injured and fell down there near the road.  This is nobody's case.  He says that he did not talk with the informant nor did he see him doing anything.

He had left behind three sons, two daughters and a widow. Cherukuri Seetharamaswamy (A-1) is his third son whereas Cherukuri Kalidas (since deceased) was his second son. Appasani Vasumathi Devi (P.W.1) is one of the daughters of Cherukuri Sambaiah who was married to Nageswara Rao of village Takkellapadu. After the death of her husband she has been residing at her parents house at Pedda Makkans. Cherukuri Sambaiah during his life-time divided his properties amongst his wife Cherukuri, Saraswathamma (P.W.2). Cherukuri Kalidas (since deceased) was a doctor having two wives, namely, Pushpavani and Tripuranani Hemalatha (P.W.3) who are sisters. Cherukuri Kalidas and his two wives went to Iran and stayed there for about ten years. During his absence the property allotted to his share was looked after by A-I. Cherukuri Kalidas returned to Guntur from Iran five years before the incident that took place on 1991 and opened his clinic at Guntur. Cherukuri Kalidas on his return used to go to his village Pedda Makanna occasionally and took over the management of his property from A- The mother of Cherukuri Kalidas and A-1 were residing together in the village Pedda Makanna and her share comprising of ten acres of land was also looked after by him. Cherukuri Kalidas asked A-1 to furnish the account f his properties in his possession during his stay at Iran. This caused an ill-feeling between Cherukuri Kalidas and A- 1. The dispute between the two brothers was sought to be resolved by the villagers but their efforts failed and because of this the people of the said village were divided into two groups. This acrimony also resulted into some incidents between these two groups including the incidents of throwing of bombs on each others which gave rise to the registration of crimes against them as also proceedings under Section 107 Cr P.C. 2. On or about in the month of May 1991, a month prior to the incident in question one Rangavali who was running a private school died of heart attack and in that connection M. Boddu Sambasivarao, the sympathiser of the said lady teacher filed report against A-1 alleging that he caused her death by administering the poison. A-1 believed that he was involved falsely in the said crime at the instance of Cherukuri Kalidas and it was this belief that led to further strained relation between them. 3. It is alleged by the prosecution that on 1991 at about 6 p.m. Cherukuri Kalidas along with his wife Tripuranani Hemalatha (P.W.3) came to Pedda Makkana on the scooter. After taking dinner they went to sleep in their room. Cherukuri Saraswathamma (P.W.2) the mother and Tripuranani Hemalatha (P.W.3) the sister also went to sleep in another room. A-1 was having his house adjacent to the house of Cherukuri Kalidas. It is alleged by the prosecution that during that night at bout 2 a.m. A-1 and his five associated armed with deadly weapons entered into the room where Cherukuri Kalidas was sleeping with his wife Tripuranani Hemalatha (P.W.3). During the night an electric bulb was also burning in the house. A-1 and his five associates stated attacking Cherukuri Kalidas with deadly weapons. When Tripuranani Hemalatha (P.W.3) got up, she raised an alarm and tried to intervene but in vain. A-1 and his associated also caused injuries to her. His sister Appasani Vasumathi Devi (P.W.1) and Cherukuri Saraswathamma (P.W.2), the mother, after hearing the cries of Cherukuri Kalidas came to the room and found that A-1 and his five associates were assaulting Cherukuri Kalidas and when they tries to intervene they were also assaulted by these assailants. P.W.1 and P.W.3 sustained bleeding industries whereas Dr. Kalidas was found lying dead on the floor. The deceased and the injured were thereafter removed to the general hospital, Guntur for medical treatment. Cherukuri Kalidas was declared dead and other injured persons were referred to the experts for better treatment. Dr. D. Veeraraju (P.W.16) sent an intimation to the IVth Additional Munsif Magistrate. Guntur who came and recorded the dying declaration (Exb. P-1) of Tripuranani Hemalatha (P.W.3). V, Anjaneyulu (P.W.9), the Head Constable attached to the Government General Hospital received an intimation about the incident along with the copy of the dying declaration which he forwarded to Kothapet Police Station. Samasivrao, the Head Constable (P.W.10) registered the crime under Sections 147, 148, 324, 7 and 302 read with Section 149 Indian Penal Code, 1860 at about 12 noon on 91 and transferred the same to SHO. Sattenapalli Rural Police Station for investigation since the jurisdiction vested in that police station. The crime came to be registered accordingly at Sattenpalli Police Station and the copies of the FIR were forwarded to the concerned Magistrate and other police officers. sectionA. Unmistakably proved that A-1 to A-5 tresspassed into the room at 00 a.m. on 1991 deadly weapons where Cherukuri Kalidas was sleeping with his wife. The actual assault was witnessed by his wife Tripuranani Hemalatha (P.W.3) and she has stated all necessary details about the assault caused by A-1 to A- Her evidence was supported by mother and sister of A- The evidence of these three witnesses unmistakably indicates that Cherukuri Kalidas died on the spot because of several injuries caused by A-1 to A- 5. This evidence finds support from the medical evidence of Dr. K. Mahipal Reddy (P.W.15) who performed the autopsy on the dead body. As far as the part played by A-1 is concerned, we have to agree with the finding of the learned Sessions Judge that he was responsible for causing death of the deceased. As far as the part played by A-3 and A-4 are concerned, since the findings are that their role resulted in grievous hurt on the body of the deceased and simple //injuries on other witnesses i.e. P.W.1 to But the same does not disclose any common intention along with A- Hence they are not liable to be punished under Section 302 Indian Penal Code, 1860. or Section 304-I of Indian Penal Code, 1860, but under Section 326 of Indian Penal Code, 1860. The entire premiss of the discussion of the evidence of Appasani Vasumathi Devi (P.W.2) and Tripuraneni Hemalatha (P.W.3) made by the High Court was totally contrary to the evidence of these eye witnesses. The most important circumstance which the High Court lost sight of was that at the dead hours of the night A-1 to A-5 tresspassed into the room with deadly weapons where Cherukuri Kalidas was sleeping. What could be their common object ? Can it not be absolute certainty inferred from the proved facts that they (accused) were members of an unlawful assembly who came together at the dead hours of the night with the deadly weapons shared a common object of assault Cherukuri Kalidas and in Pursuance thereof assaulted him resulting into his instantaneous death ? Answer has to be in the affirmative. A-1 to A-5 were identified not only by Tripuranani Hemalatha (P.W.2) and Appasani Vasumathi Devi (P.W.1) mother and sister respectively of A- Despite such convincing, cogent and satisfactory evidence on record the High Court held that the prosecution has failed to establish a common intention on the part of A-1 to A-5 to commit the murder of Cherukuri Kalidas and also to cause injuries to Cherukuri Saraswathamma (P.W.2) and Tripuranani Hemalatha (P.W.3). The further finding that A-1 to A-5 did not share common intention while causing a murderous assault on Cherukuri Kalidas is equally wrong. The High Court has totally overlooked the evidence of eye witnesses which has proved the common object of the Unlawful assembly of which A-1 to A-5 were members, attracting the provisions of Section 149 Indian Penal Code, 1860 and in pursuance thereof committed the murder of Cherukuri Kalidas. Cherukuri Saraswathamma (P.W.2) and Tripuranani Hemalatha (P.W.3) in a proper perspective and had rightly concluded that A-1 to A-5 shared a common object while committing the tresspass into the room of Cherukuri Kalidas to assault him with the deadly weapons which common object they (accused) carried out. Cherukuri Saraswathamma (P.W.2) and Teripuranani Hemalatha (P.W.3) are the injured witnesses of whom the former is the mother and latter the wife. They tried to intervene during the assault on Cherukuri Kalidas but they were also not spared by A-1 to A-5 who caused serious injuries to them as would be evident from the medical evidence on record.

Birni, District Giridih and picked up a fight with the said 2 persons. Being afraid of attack on themselves said Ugan Mandal and Shankar Mandal ran away from the said place. The prosecution further alleges that after the said persons ran away, the accused returned back to the village. On the way they met Jhalar Mandal uncle of abovesaid Ugan Mandal who happened to ask them what the matter was. Being enraged by such a question from Jhalar Mandal the appellants herein allegedly hit him on his head with a lathi as a result of which he received injury on his head and fell down. Prosecution then alleges that all other accused persons also assaulted said Jhalar Mandal which was noticed by Ugan Mandal and on his raising an alarm his son Dhanu Mandal and nephew Bhuneshwar Mandal also reached the place and they were also assaulted by the accused. When other villagers came to the place of occurrence the accused persons went away. Said Ugan Mandal and other relatives of Jhalar Mandal then took the injured Jhalar Mandal to Giridih hospital where he died. Based on a complaint lodged by Ugan Mandal after completion of investigation 6 persons including the 2 appellants in this appeal were charged for offences mentioned hereinabove. From the evidence of the doctor (P.W.7), it appears that Jhalar Mandal had only the injury on his head, which is said to be the cause of his death. From the evidence on record, it is clear that at the time when the second incident took place which led to the death of the deceased even according to the prosecution, none of the accused persons was motivated by any particular desire to attack Jhalar Mandal. The incident in question occurred on the spur of the moment without there being any intention of causing death or of causing such injury as they knew was likely to cause death, and was an act arising out of the enmity they had with the nephew of the deceased and aggravated by the unwanted questioning by the deceased. From the evidence it is clear that the act of the appellant cannot be construed as an act other than causing grievous hurt.

It is alleged in the FIR that on the previous day two trees of Khair had fallen down and on the date of occurrence at about 8 oclock in the morning when the informant wanted the trees to be cut into pieces, allegedly the five accused persons, Brij Lal, Dev Raj and the three appellants came at the spot and started beating him. Brij Lal was having gun which he fired at his left jaw. Dev Raj assaulted with axe at the right arm. The victim came back to home and was taken to hospital where he gave the statement to police which is contained in the FIR. As PW-1, the victim Shriram deposed on 2012 in Court giving details of civil dispute/land dispute between him and his brothers. He claimed to have forbidden the accused persons from lifting the pieces of fallen trees and when his orders were ignored, he protested and resultantly suffered a gun shot injury on the left side of his face at the hands of accused Brij Lal. He was then caught by Dev Raj who gave him a kick with his right knee and as a result he fell down. Thereafter Dev Raj caused an injury on his right hand with an axe. Thereafter an obvious improvement has appeared in the deposition of the victim that appellant no. 2 Fullan Devi attacked him with a darat (sharp cutting weapon) which hit on his left hand, the other two appellants also gave him beatings with kicks and fist blows. He has specified that blood oozed out only from left jaw and right hand. Dev Raj allegedly run away with the gun. In the next breath he added that Dev Raj ran away from the spot along with the appellants. Only Brij Lal remained at the spot and he further assaulted the victim as a result whereof he fell down. Since son of the victim was away from the village, his two daughters- in-law came to the spot and took him to his house. His son came later and took him on a vehicle to Bilaspur where he was subjected to x-ray and some treatment and then referred to a hospital at Shimla. But before that his statement was recorded by the police at Bilaspur. The trial court judgment discloses that the defence confronted the victim PW-1 with his earlier statement wherein he had not alleged that Fullan Devi assaulted him with a darat. The medical evidence of PW-17, Dr. Superiya Atwal proves the injury on left side of the face of PW-1 to be a gun shot injury. The second injury was an abrasion on the medial aspect of left hand, 5x1 cm in size. The third injury was a bleeding one on the back of right hand 5x5x1/4 cm in size extending from thumb region to middle finger. The fourth injury was again an abrasion on front of right thigh of 2x1 cm in size. According to Doctor, the injury no. 2 could have been caused with blunt side of darat, whereas injury no.3 could have been caused by an axe. Injuries no. 2 and 4 were opined as simple in nature. A careful analysis of the injuries as proved by the medical evidence creates a distinct impression that injury no. 2 is not by a sharp cutting weapon like darat and besides being simple it may have been on account of fall. The victim, PW 1 has admitted that after receiving gun shot injury he was assaulted by Dev Raj and made to fall. He has also alleged further assault by Brij Lal after the other accused had gone away. Coupled with this fact the initial version also creates a serious doubt that specific allegations against the appellants have been developed later in the course of deposition in Court. The broad features of the case also reveal that the two male accused were allegedly having a gun and an axe in their hand and they used these weapons only to cause injuries which did not pose any danger to the life of the victim. In such circumstances the women accused could have hardly any reason to unnecessarily get involved into assault so as to cause simple injuries by fists and kicks.", "statute": ["s1"]}, "2004.INSC.663.txt": {"doc_url": "http://www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/2004/663.html", "explanation": {"There were three eye witnesses who have categorically stated about the manner in which the injury was caused.": ["s1"], "The evidence must be tested for its inherent consistency and the inherent probability of the story; consistency with the account of other witnesses held to be credit-worthy; consistency with the undisputed facts; the 'credit' of the witnesses; their performance in the witness-box; their power of observation etc.": ["s1"], "In the instant case the prosecution has indicated the reasons as to why it did not choose to examine the alleged independent persons.": ["s1"], "There is nothing unusual in the conduct of the eye witnesses as was inferred by the High Court.": ["s1"], "The High Court found that the business of the PW1 was claimed to be a supply of milk, but no sufficient basis have been indicated as to where he was going to sell milk at the time of alleged offence.": ["s1"]}, "fact": " On the fateful day i.e. on 1989 at around 7 o'clock in the evening an information was received in the police station that one Manni and his friends, who were wanted, were hiding in the house of one Mannu Teli. The deceased accompanied by head-constable Dayaram went in their search to the house of that Mannu Teli. At the house of Mannu Teli, his daughter Sunita met the police party and quarreled with them. Later on, on the same day at about 45 P.M. she provoked the present respondents and four others viz. , Bhure, Jabar Singh, Ramkishore and Kapoor Singh by weeping before them and telling them that the deceased had insulted her. They all conspired to kill the deceased on that very day. Thereafter when the deceased Hamid Khan came to the betel shop of one Santosh in Seodha itself, those persons excluding Kapoor Singh came there in two batches of three each armed with sword, Gupti etc. After reaching near the shop of said Santosh, accused Bhure caught hold of the deceased and thereafter Jabbarsingh gave a blow by sword injuring the deceased below his left ear. Then accused Manni inflicted an injury below his right ear with a Gupti. As the deceased fell on ground, Kapoor Singh asked others to kill him. Accused Dharkole picking up a stone which was lying nearby; assaulted on the head of deceased. Kapoor Singh warned all those present there not to utter a word. Accused Komal thereafter kicked the deceased and all of them went away from there. However, one Ashok Sindhi informed head-constable Dayaram, who was on duty at that time at the Municipal House that some one has beaten one constable near the shop of Santosh. On receiving this information, head- constable Dayaram reached the spot and found the deceased lying seriously wounded. Suspecting the hands of present respondents and their friends in it because of the earlier attempt for their arrest, he informed his officer at police station. The Officer- in-charge of the police station thereafter reached the spot, inspected it and seized the blood stained and non-stained mud from the spot and the blood stained stone which was also lying nearby together with a wooden handle of Gupti. The deceased who was at that time only injured was immediately referred to Hospital and from the Hospital was referred to Gwalior for better treatment. On reaching Gwalior he was declared dead at Gwalior Hospital by the doctor concerned. Autopsy was performed by Dr. Vijay Kumar Diwan (PW-5) and it was found that he has succumbed to the injuries found on the body. Dr. V.S. Singh (PW-15), who had examined the deceased in Seodha, had found one lacerated wound on the parietal region, one abrasion on the neck and five incised wounds. Out of these five incised wounds two were on the left side of his face, one below the ear and the other on the mandible and remaining three were on the right side of the face, one on the ear and two on the mandible. There were three eye witnesses who have categorically stated about the manner in which the injury was caused. The evidence must be tested for its inherent consistency and the inherent probability of the story; consistency with the account of other witnesses held to be credit-worthy; consistency with the undisputed facts; the 'credit' of the witnesses; their performance in the witness-box; their power of observation etc. In the instant case the prosecution has indicated the reasons as to why it did not choose to examine the alleged independent persons. There is nothing unusual in the conduct of the eye witnesses as was inferred by the High Court. The High Court has put unwarranted stress on certain aspects like the political party accused Dharkoke belonged, or the place from where the witnesses came together.

When they reached near Khatakiya Tiraha, all accused persons who were hiding themselves in the shadow of a Mini Bus and armed with lethal weapons, like lathi, farsa and luhangi appeared, stopped the motor-cycle driven by Ramesh Singh and started beating him by inflicting blows. Accused-2 Bhagwan Singh caused farsa blow on the left hand of Ramesh, Accused-1 Tulsiram caused luhangi blow on parietal region of Ramesh Singh, Accused-4 Daku and Accused-3 Roop Singh gave lathi blows on legs and knees of Ramesh Singh. Raghuveer 3 Singh Meena came to the rescue of Ramesh Singh, but Accused-1 Tulsiram inflicted luhangi blow over his right hand. Raghuveer Singh Meena, hence, immediately ran away from the place of occurrence. Several injuries were caused by accused persons to Ramesh Singh. Ramesh Singh fell down and became unconscious. All the accused then took Ramesh Singh and threw him in the pit. Hari Singh, Chandan Singh and Ram Singh meanwhile came at the place of occurrence and saw the accused running away from the place. vRamesh Singh was then taken out of the pit, was placed in a Matador and was taken to the Police Station Kumbhraj. Injured Raghuveer Singh Meena also reached the Police Station. 4. According to prosecution, Ramesh Singh and injured Raghuveer Singh were plying passenger-jeep between Kumbhraj to Khatakiya and Khatakiya to Kumbhraj. The accused persons demanded rs.50/- per day, per trip. The injured, however, did not oblige the accused which was the route cause and with a view to 4 teach a lesson to Ramesh Singh and Raghuveer Singh, the accused persons assaulted them. After usual investigation, challan was filed in the Court of Judicial Magistrate, First Class who passed an order of committal in view of the case being triable by a Court of Session. The accused did not plead guilty and claimed to be tried. 6. The prosecution, to prove its case against the accused, examined fourteen witnesses. The learned Additional Sessions Judge held that the prosecution was able to establish the case beyond reasonable doubt against the accused and after hearing them, passed an order of conviction and sentence. The High Court confirmed the order passed by the trial court. 7. Against the order of conviction and sentence, the appellants have approached this 5 Court.  The learned counsel for the appellants invited our attention to the deposition of PW4- Dr. A.D. Chinchurkar. He stated that on October 1, 1997 at 30 p.m. , Ramesh Singh, son of Madansingh Meena was brought by constable Rambharose for his medical examination. Ramesh Singh was unconscious. Whole body with clothes had been soiled with wet soil. Breathe and heartbeat was continuing. He found following three injuries from the person of Ramesh Singh: 10 1. Lacerated wound on scalp of head 6x1 cm x 1 cm scalp thickness deep in middle of scalp on left side. 2. One lacerated wound in 1x1x5 cm area on backside of head. 3. One lacerated broken wound 2x1x5 cm on left hand with apparent fracture of bone. 13. According to this witness, all the three injuries appeared to have been caused with `hard and blunt' weapons. In cross- examination, the witness stated that Ramesh Singh had sustained `only three injuries'. He further admitted that the injuries could not possibly be sustained with any sharp weapon. 14. Now, reading the evidence of victim Ramesh Singh, injured and the star witness of the prosecution, it is clear that according to him, he was `attacked' by Accused no.1- Tulsiram, Accused no.2-Bhagwan Singh, Accused no.3-Roop Singh and Accused no.4-Daku. Bhagwan Singh had administered farsi blow on his left hand. Tulsiram had given luhagi blow on 11 forehead and Daku and Roop Singh gave lathi blows. He stated that in his police statement, besides names of four accused, he had not mentioned any other name. In view of the above statement, the prosecution requested the Court to declare the witness `hostile' and permission was sought to put questions which could be put in cross-examination. Such permission was granted. It was then brought on record that in the police statement, the witness had stated that over and above the accused persons, one Harsingh Meena, Ramcharan Meena and Harbhajan Meena were also present with lathis and they had also inflicted lathi blows on the witness and had thrown him in the ditch. The witness though admitted in the cross-examination that he could not say exact number of injuries he had sustained but there were more than 28 injuries on his whole body. Out of those injuries, 5-6 injuries were of grievous nature and remaining injuries were simple. 12 15. From the deposition of other injured witness Raghuvir Singh also, it appears that the prosecution has not come forward with all facts. In his evidence on oath, Raghuvir Singh stated that Tulsiram had given wood blow to him and then stated that Tulsiram had given luhagi blow to Ramesh and lathi blow to the witnesections The witness then ran away from there out of fear. According to the witness, after running away from the place of occurrence, he went to nursery situated near Khatkiya and then reached Kumbhraj where he lodged report at Police Station, Kumbhraj. The witness asserted that the police had written his report and obtained his signature on the report. No such report, however, has been produced by the prosecution at the trial. 16. PW9-Hari Singh, in his statement admitted that he had seen the quarrel while returning from Fadalpur to Kumbhraj. According to him, the accused persons present in the Court had beaten Ramesh Singh. The witness 13 intervened in the fight and requested the accused persons not to beat Ramesh Singh. He, however, stated that except the witness, nobody intervened in the fight. Later on, Ram Singh came there and the witness and Ram Singh pulled Ramesh out of the ditch. He further stated that besides the three accused, nobody had beaten Ramesh. 17. The Addl. Public Prosecutor, in respect of this witness (Hari Singh) also, made prayer to the Court to declare him `hostile' and to permit to put questions which could be put in cross-examination and the permission was granted. The witness was then confronted with his police statement wherein he stated that Tulsiram Meena, Bhagwan Singh Meena, Roop Singh Meena and Daku Meena were beating Ramesh Singh with lathi, luhagi and farsi with intention to kill him. Though the witness denied it and went to the extent that the police did not record his statement, the contradiction had been duly established. He went to the extent that police 14 had written wrong statement. He denied that accused Roop Singh Meena had beaten Ramesh Singh in his presence and that it was wrong that in collusion with accused Roop Singh, he was not giving correct evidence. From the above evidence and discussion, it appears that the prosecution has not come with clean hands and the genesis becomes doubtful. Not only that three other persons were present at the scene of offence, but they were armed with weapons, their common object was to beat the witness and in fact they attacked the witness with lathis. The initial case, however, was subsequently totally changed and the 15 witness had gone to the extent that over and above four accused before the Court, nobody was present and he was not attacked and beaten by anyone else. 19. According to the said witness, he had sustained several injuries (28 injuries) but according to the medical evidence, there were only three injuries on the person of Ramesh Singh. Further, according to the witness, the injuries were caused by farsi, luhangi and sticks. Medical opinion, on the other hand, goes to show that injuries were possible by `hard' and `blunt' substance and not by any `sharp' weapon. All the three injuries referred to hereinabove also clearly prove it. They were all lacerated wounds and no incise wound was found on the person of Ramesh Singh. 20. PW6-Raghuveer Singh's evidence also was shaky. He was not sure as to with which weapon, he was beaten.", "statute": ["s1"]}, "2003.INSC.110.txt": {"doc_url": "http://www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/2003/110.html", "explanation": {"near the

PW 4 becomes doubtful, it is not possible to place reliance upon the statements of PWs.": ["s1"], "5 and 8 who claimed that they had seen the accused persons fleeing away, especially when the same are not corroborated by PW.": ["s1"]}, "fact": " Prosecution case, in short, is that on 14th February, 1990, Manna Lal and Kanwar Lal were coming from village Gehoon Kheda and when they arrived on a pathway at about 00 p.m. near the field of one Chandra Singh, Gopal (PW 4), who was working on his field, found that all the accused persons, including the respondents, armed with sword and gandasis, who were waiting there from before in the field of Chandra Singh, chased Manna Lal and Kanwar Lal and assaulted them with their respective weapons. Seeing the assault on Manna Lal and Kanwar Lal, who were uncle and father respectively of Gopal (PW 4), he went towards the village and on the way met his brothers Kalyan (PW 5), Jamna Lal (PW 6) and Dhanna Lal (PW 8) and disclosed to them names of the accused persons, including the respondents. Thereupon, the aforesaid three persons came to the place of occurrence and saw the accused persons fleeing away. Manna Lal died instantaneously but Kanwar Lal, who succumbed to the injuries after some time, made an oral dying declaration before the informant-PW 4 disclosing therein names of the accused persons, including respondent Sheo Singh and one Ram Singh, without disclosing their parentage. According to the first information report, the occurrence was witnessed by Mangi Lal Bagri (PW 7) and Mangi Lal Meena besides the informant-PW On the basis of the statement of Gopal (PW 4), the first information report is said to have been lodged on the same day at 00 p.m. The police after registering the case took up investigation and on completion thereof submitted charge sheet on receipt whereof, the Magistrate took cognizance and committed all the twenty four accused persons, including the respondents, to the court of Session to face trial. According to the first information report, three persons namely, Gopal (PW 4-informant), Mangi Lal Bagri (PW 7) and Mange Lal Meena had witnessed the alleged occurrence. Apart from these three persons, Jamna Lal (PW 6) was examined, who claimed to be an eyewitness to the occurrence, but his evidence has been disbelieved by the trial court itself. Mangi Lal Bagri, (PW 7), who according to the FIR was an eyewitness, has been also disbelieved by the trial court. The third eyewitness is Mange Lal Meena who could have been independent witness to unfold the truth but for the reasons best known to the prosecution, his evidence has been withheld. Thus, the only eye witness remains is Gopal (PW 4). PW 4-the informant is nobody else than the nephew of deceased Manna Lal and son of another deceased Kanwar Lal. He has admitted that his family and the accused persons were at daggers drawn. The first information report is said to have been recorded by the Sub-Inspector of Police Samdarshan Pandey (PW 18). This witness in his very examination-in-chief stated that when he went to Aklera police station to lodge a report, at the police station he met Bhanwar Singh, Station House Officer and narrated him the whole incident which was the first version of the occurrence disclosed by PW 4 before the police. But the said statement made by PW 4 before him has not been brought on the record and for the reasons best known to it withheld by the prosecution. It may be possible that in the said statement, PW 4 might not have disclosed names of any of the accused and subsequently, after due deliberation, the first information report was lodged roping therein the respondents as well which might be the reason for delay in sending the first information report to court for which no reasonable explanation has been furnished and the same would be apparent from the facts mentioned hereunder. The explanation furnished by the prosecution for sending the first information report to court after two days is that because of general election, staff was not available on 14th and 15th February, The distance of police station is 18 k.m. from the place of occurrence. The police station, hospital and the court campus are within a radius of half a kilometer. According to the statement of Dr. Kundan Mal Jain (PW 17), constable brought two dead bodies for postmortem examination on 15th February, As the court campus and the hospital are within a radius of half a kilometer, there was no reason why the first information report was not handed over to the same constable who brought dead bodies to the hospital. Thus, the explanation furnished by the prosecution for causing delay in sending the first information report does not appear to be plausible and as according to the statement of PW 4 referred to above, the prosecution has withheld the first version of the occurrence disclosed before the police, the chances of manipulation in the first information report cannot be ruled out and the delay in sending the first information report to court becomes material. It may be stated that the informant-PW4 stated in the first information report that his father-Kanwar Lal made a dying declaration before him in which he disclosed names of seven persons, including respondent Sheo Singh besides one Ram Singh without disclosing his parentage and as two Ram Singhs are accused and only one of them is respondent, it is not known whose name was disclosed by informant's father before him in the dying declaration. So far this dying declaration said to have been made by informant's father before him is concerned, this could have been best piece of evidence so far respondent Sheo Singh is concerned, but the prosecution has given a complete go-by to the same as in the statement made in court, this witness did not state that his father made any dying declaration before him. The informant (PW 4) specifically stated in his statement made in court that his father Kanwar Lal made a dying declaration before the police when it arrived and disclosed therein names of his assailants. It is not known whether in the said dying declaration, names of the respondents were mentioned or not. This could have been material evidence in support of the prosecution case showing complicity of the respondents with the crime. But the prosecution for the reasons best known to it has withheld the said dying declaration from court for which no reason whatsoever has been furnished. The other two witnesses upon whom trial court placed reliance are Kalyan (PW 5) and Dhanna Lal (PW 8). According to the first information report, none of these witnesses was eyewitness, but when the informant went to the village after the occurrence, he met them on the way, disclosed the names of the accused persons to them and thereafter when they arrived at the place of occurrence, the accused persons were seen fleeing away. In court PW.4 has simply stated that on way to the village he met these witnesses, but did not state that he disclosed names of accused to them. Even these two witnesses have not stated that the informant disclosed names of the accused persons before them but simply stated that his father and uncle were murdered. Thus, the prosecution case that when the informant (PW 4) met these witnesses on his way to the village, he disclosed names of the accused persons has not been proved either by the informant or any other witnesections These witnesses simply stated that PW 4 stated to them that Manna Lal and Kanwar Lal had been murdered and on their arrival at the place of occurrence, the accused persons, including the respondents, were seen fleeing away, which statement has not been supported by PW.4 as he has no where stated in court that these two witnesses had seen the accused persons fleeing away. In view of the fact that first version of the occurrence, as unfolded by PW 4, has been withheld by the prosecution, it is not safe to place reliance upon the evidence of this witness who is partisan and inimical witness, more so, when the dying declarations of Kanwar Lal made before the informant as well as the police disclosing therein names of the assailants have not been brought on the record. As the evidence of PW 4 becomes doubtful, it is not possible to place reliance upon the statements of PWs. 5 and 8 who claimed that they had seen the accused persons fleeing away, especially when the same are not corroborated by PW.", "statute": ["s1"]}, "2008.INSC.1838.txt": {"doc_url": "http://www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/2008/1838.html", "explanation": {"It was stated that combined effect of injury Nos.": ["s1"], "1, 3, 4 and 5 was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.": ["s1"], "Looking to the injuries sustained by the deceased which were not on head, face or vital part of the body, but on arms, legs etc.": ["s1"], "coupled with the fact that in all, there were six accused and though all of them were convicted by the trial Court, the High Court extended benefit of doubt to accused Nos.": ["s1"], "2-6, in our opinion, the counsel is right in submitting that on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, it cannot be said that the appellant herein had committed an offence punishable under Section 302, Indian Penal Code, 1860.": ["s1"]}, "fact": " It was the case of the prosecution that six accused in Sessions Case no. 48 of 1996, in prosecution of their common object to cause death of Balan on account of previous enmity formed themselves into an unlawful assembly on May 25, 1995 at about 30 p.m. near the Forest out post in Maniyar Nalumakku and committed an offence of rioting.

He also narrated in the said complaint the individual weapons carried by these accused persons. It was mentioned in the said complaint that these accused persons were shouting Maro Sale Ko and surrounded his house from all four sides. Having seen the mob coming towards them, he, his father and Jatan Sah went inside the house and closed its eastern door. The complainant goes on to say that from amongst the accused persons, Hira Rai, Daroga Rai, Mofil Rai, Sk. Motlif, Ali Imam, Durbal Rai, Banka Rai, Bacha Rai, Wakil Rai and Baijnath Rai with the help of some others broke open the northern door of his house while some of the accused removed the Tatti of the eastern door of the house and entered the house.

At that point of time, when Amir Rai son of Kalyug Das came out of his house, the aforementioned accused persons attacked him in the courtyard of his house and inflicted injuries on his body. While Amir Rai was being attacked, the assailants also attacked Muni Devi wife of Sheo Bachan Rai. After the said assault, it is stated that all the accused persons fled from the scene of occurrence. The complainant has named, among others, Jawahar Rai, Ram Babu Rai and Deep Lal Rai; all residents of Murli village as having witnessed the incident. He also stated that at the time of fleeing away, some of the accused persons, who have been named in the complaint separately, also took away two tin boxes containing one gold hasuli valued at rs.8,000/-, silver chandrahar valued at rs.1,600/-, Tika of gold valued at rs.2,000/-, Payal of Chandi valued at rs.800/-, certain sarees and blouses and cash of rs.3,000/- and a motorcycle of Jatan Sah which was parked near the front door of his house. The prosecution through the evidence of PWs.6 and 7 - the doctors who conducted the post mortem on the deceased Jai Mangal Rai, Jatan Sah and Sheo Bachan Rai has established that the aforesaid deceased died a homicidal death due to the injuries caused to them by sharp cutting weapons and other hard blunt substances similar to the weapons carried by the accused persons, as stated by the prosecution witnesses.

From the evidence of the eye-witnesses out of which many are either injured witnesses or the relatives of the deceased persons whose presence at the time of the incident cannot be doubted, it is clear that the incident under reference has occurred as presented by the prosecution case. Their evidence is quite consistent and has withstood the test of cross-examination. In the process of achieving the said object, they had also looted the property belonging to the witnesses. Since the incident in question has taken place for a considerable long time at different places near about the house of PW-1, the witnesses were in a position to see and identify the accused and their participation in the crime.

Similarly on prosecution side, Shivakumar (PW-2), Lokesh (PW-3) and Murthappa (PW-7) are the sons of the Kenchappa (hereinafter referred to as `deceased'). Relation between the accused group and the deceased and his family 3 members was strained over erecting an electric pole in the land of the accused, the line of which would have passed and benefited the deceased and his borewell in the land near by which was objected by the accused. This ill will and enmity ultimately resulted in the assault on the deceased and his sons on On that day, there was a festival and a procession was taken of the deity by the villagers. The deceased and his children had also joined the procession. According to the prosecution when the procession came near the post office by the side of which is also the house of the accused, the accused group suddenly pounced upon the deceased and his children and assaulted them. This took place around 30 P.M. , or so in the evening. After the assault Kenchappa (deceased), P.W.2 Shivakumar, Lokesh were taken to the hospital. In spite of the treatment given to the injured Kenchappa, he breathed his last on Thereafter, PW-1 a nephew of the deceased approached the jurisdictional police at Holalkere and gave his written information as per exhibitP.1, P.W.25 Mohammad Arif, sectionH.O.

In the instant case, though large number of co-accused have been acquitted that cannot be a ground to discard the evidence of trustworthy witnesses. The doctor's evidence is by way of hypothetical answer that the death would not occur because of the injuries received by sharp edged weapon.

On 0-1993, at about 30 a.m. , he was going to a mosque for offering the morning prayers. He was returning back to his house accompanied by one Rasheed (PW-2) from the mosque. John Basha (deceased) and Usman Ali (PW-3, the injured), were walking ahead of them. Saleem (PW-4) and one Mubarak were behind them. 3. When the deceased, PW-2 and PW-3 turned towards a lane which was on the eastern side of the house of PW-2, the appellant and Udayakumar were seen coming from the opposite direction. Appellant allegedly shouted that they were the persons who had thrown the bomb at the RSS office and started stabbing the deceased indiscriminately. PW-3 (Usman Ali) was allegedly stabbed by Udayakumar. When they cried for help, the appellant allegedly picked up a stone and dropped it on the head of the deceased. Appellant and the said Udayakumar thereafter allegedly ran away from the place of occurrence. 4. A First Information Report was lodged against unknown. No mark of identification of the accused was also disclosed therein. While, however, the Investigating Officer was preparing an inquest report, the first informant allegedly disclosed to him that he had noticed a scar on the right hand of one of the assailants. On or about 1993, i.e. after five days, the appellant was arrested. The said Udayakumar was also arrested. Their photographs were published in a local daily with the caption that they were the persons who were the accused of causing murder of John Basha and injury to PW- 5. The said publication was made in a Tamil daily 'Dinakaran' on Prior thereto or immediately thereafter, the appellant and the said Udayakumar was not put on test identification parade. They were put on test identification parade only on In the said purported test identification parade, whereas PW-1 and PW-3 purported to have identified the appellant, PW-2 and PW-4 could not identify even Accused no.6. We may at the outset notice the evidence of the first informant (PW-1). According to him, the appellant and the said Udayakumar had been running towards John Basha (deceased) and Usman Ali (PW-3) from about a distance of 15 feet from them. According to him, nobody shouted when the first injury was inflicted. Apart from those two, he stated, nobody else was touched. He stated that he been knowing the accused persons from before as also their names, but then stated that he did not know the same at that time. According to him, he had mentioned in the First Information Report about the scar which he had noticed on the right hand of the appellant, but the First Information Report does not show it. He accepted that the photographs of the appellant and the said Udayakumar had appeared in the newspaper that they had committed the murder of John Basha. PW-2 even could not remember as to whether he had identified the appellant on the basis of scar mark. PW-3 allegedly had disclosed the mark of identification. His statement must have been taken after the inquest report was made. PW-4 even could not say whether he had seen the appellant and the said Udayakumar prior to the date of occurrence. But still then according to him their faces were known. He could not even recollect as to whether he had stated about the said identification mark to anybody else. 11. Photograph of the deceased which had been published in Tamil daily 'Dinakaran' was proved by one King Kong, who examined himself as DW- He pursuant to the summons issued to him had brought with him a copy of the newspaper dated He in his deposition stated that in the fourth page of the newspaper, two photographs were published showing the persons connected with Tirupur murder case. Their names were also disclosed therein as Udayakumar and Ravi. He was not even cross- examined. Objections were taken by the accused that their photographs had been taken in the police station. It has further been accepted that whereas the Accused no. 1 was short in stature, the appellant was tall. The age of the persons who had been selected for test identification parade had not been noted by the Magistrate, who conducted the test identification parade. No person having similar scar mark on his hand was put on the test identification parade. PW-2, who had come to identify after the first witness was sent to the same place. Where PW-1 was sent immediately after the test identification parade, chance of their disclosure about the appellant to PW-3 and others cannot be ruled out. He had identified one Raju, who was not connected with the case. Similarly, Usman Ali (PW-3) had identified one Arun who was not involved in the case. He in the second and third identification had identified one Raju, apart from the said Arun, who was again not connected with the case. The test identification parade was held after ten days. It is also not in dispute that the photographs of the accused were taken at the police station.r The Investigation Officer allowed them to be published. Photographs of the appellant and the said Udayakumar were not only published, according to the prosecution witnesses, they were shown to be the accused in the aforementioned crime. Some of the them admittedly were aware of the said publication. The purported test identification parade which was held ten days thereafter, in our opinion, looses all significance, in the aforementioned fact situation. The witnesses were not very sure as to whether they had seen the appellant before. Had the accused been known, their identity would have been disclosed in the First Information Report. PW-1 for the first time before the court stated that he had known the accused from long before, but did not know their names earlier, although he came to know of their names at a later point of time. 18. Except A1, however, they were not arrested. The reason for their being not arrested had not been disclosed. They were arrested, as noticed hereinbefore, on 2000 only after their names were disclosed by PWs 7 and Test Identification Parade of the accused persons, other than A1, was held on Why the Investigating Officer took such a long time for arranging a test identification parade has not been disclosed. Furthermore, A3 was not identified. A6 was present when the first Test Identification Parade was taken but he had not been identified by any of the witnesses. We have seen the newspaper cutting. Photographs of the two accused have been shown; their names as accused had also been disclosed. It was, therefore, wholly unnecessary for DW-1 to identify the accused persons in dock. Not only the authenticity of such publication has not been questioned by the prosecution, DW-1, was not cross-examined at all.

After crossing DH Road and Mutha Tamil Nagar, they ran for some distance and that at that spot the accused Ali and Udattumani attacked her son Prabha with knives and inflicted out injuries on his head, and the accused Cheyya, Muthukumar, Kovil Babu, Jayaraman and 2 Karikattai Moideen inflicted out injuries on the neck, shoulder, hands, legs and several parts of the body indiscriminately, and the accused logu caught Prabha by the legs.  Thereafter of the accused together ran away from there and that her son was lying in the pool of blood and succumbed to his injuries and that later, she and her daughter-in-law went to Kodunkaiyoor Police Station and lodged the complaint Ex.P-1.  The knives exhibited in this Court were used by the accused to murder her son and the said 7 knives were marked as the M.O.1 series.  As per the chargesheet filed by the SHO of P-6 Kodunkaiyoor Police Station, Chennai, against the accused, the deceased Prabha was residing within the limits of the Kodungayoor Police Station, and that the accused were also residing in the same area.  The accused had previous enmity due to which they had murdered Babu, the brother of Prabha, and that the family members of the deceased were being threatened by the accused and that they also proposed to murder the deceased and due to this reason, all the accused with the common intention of committing the murder of Prabha, formed an unlawful assembles and armed with dangerous weapons like knife sword etc. on 9.3.2001 at 5.30 p.m stealthily entered the house of Prabha at 10 Netaji Lane, Nehru Nagar, Kodunkaiyoor, knowing that Prabha was present.

Due to the said injuries, Prabha died at the spot, and, therefore, it was stated that the accused are guilty for offences under Sections 147, 148 read with Section 302 IPC.  In the examination of PW1, it has been stated that on 8.3.2001, in the night the accused armed with knives had come and threatened to kill Prahha and that is the night when Prabha came.  She told him that he should go and hide himself and on 09.03.2001 at 5.30 A.M. in the morning, the accused armed with knives came and on seeing them Prabha ran and accused followed him and PW1 alongwith her daughter-in-law PW2 followed and after running for some distance, A2 Ali and A1 Mani cut the deceased on his head with the Kaif and A3 Cheyya, A4 Muthukumar and A6, Motilal Babu, A5, Jayaraman, A7 Muhammed cut Prabha on the shoulder and other parts of the body and A8 was holding Prabha by his legs, and these facts appear to corroborate the contents of the complaint lodged by PW1 in the Police Station.

On examining Ex.P-1 complaint it is evident that the evidence of PW1 that all the accused are known to her and that all the accused were armed with the MO1 series knives.  Therefore, on the basis of the evidence of PW1 being trustworthy and believable has been rightly acted upon.  PW1 has also stated that 5-6 months after the death of Babu, her son Prabha was killed.  On considering the evidence of PW1 that she knew the accused from their childhood and that due to the enmity of the accused with her children, they killed her sons and that on 8.3.2001 the accused armed with knives came to her house and threatened to kill Prabha and that she informed this to Prabha and that the next day, the accused came to her house, chased Prabha and killed her, it cannot be said that just because the accused were set free in the case of Babu, PW1 has with the wrong intention implicated the accused in the present case.", "statute": ["s3", "s1"]}, "2011.INSC.1208.txt": {"doc_url": "http://www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/2011/1208.html", "explanation": {"He was asked not to do so, thereupon he left the place only to return a few minutes later with accused Punja Ram, Lakha Ram, Devsi Rama, Vikram Keshu Odedara, Gangu Ranmal, Vikram Devsi 2 Odedara, Ramde Rajsi Odedara and the respondent and some others armed with knives and a pistol which the -- respondent was allegedly carrying with him.": ["s1"], "The accused persons started abusing and assaulting the complainant and others who were sitting with him resulting in knife injuries to Vikram Keshu, Navgan Arasi, Rama Arasi and Puriben.": ["s3", "s1"], "Respondent Ganga Maldebhai Odedara is alleged to have fired multiple rounds from the pistol in the air exhorting his companions to kill the complainant and others with him.": ["s3", "s1"], " Navgan Arasi died in the hospital": ["s3"]}, "fact": " ##  JETHA BHAYA ODEDARA v.

Thana) Police station in the district of Bokaro. First Information Report (FIR) in relation to the said incidence is said to 2 have been recorded at 45 p.m. in the complainant's (Suresh Kumar Das, P.W.10) house. In the FIR, it was alleged by the complainant that when his father Nagender Nath Das (deceased) and uncle Manpuran Das were sitting in front of their house after taking meal, he heard a noise (hulla) whereupon he came out and saw Ravishwar Manjhi, son of Berda Manjhi armed with `iron tenta', Jaleshwar Manjhi, son of Veda Manjhi armed with `tangi', Kala Chand Manjhi, son of Berda Manjhi, Santu Manjhi son of Balesar Manjhi armed with `bhala', Raghu Manjhi son of late Nakul Manjhi armed with `bhala' and Umakant Rajak armed with `bhala' were assaulting his father and uncle. He raised an alarm whereupon his other uncle Gour Das came to rescue them. Jaleshwar Manjhi assaulted him also with a `tangi' as a result of which he had received an injury on the palm of his right hand. Manpuran Das, his uncle sustained injuries on his left armpit, on left knee joint and on the left side of the head. Jaleshwar Manjhi caused tangi blow to his father. When he wanted to take his father with him then Ravishwar Manjhi pierced iron tenta (ballam) on the right side of the back of his father and fled away. The motive for commission of offence was stated to be objection by his father from creating nuisance by the accused in front of their house. In the FIR, it was said to have been recorded that the dead body of Nagender Nath Das was lying on the road and Gour Das was lying in injured condition and Puran Das was lying in the state of unconsciousnesections 3 4. P.W.17-Shankar Ram A.S.I. , however, stated that on the said date he had received a phone call informing him that a fight was going on at village Simultand. On the basis of the said information, he recorded a `Sanha' and proceeded towards the place of occurrence. However, admittedly, the said `Sanha' has not been produced. He, furthermore, did not disclose as to from whom he received the information. 5. Indisputably, another fard-beyan of Ravishwar Manjhi (accused no.5) was recorded by one Alok Kumar, the Investigating Officer of the present case. He, however, had not been examined by the prosecution. 6. Both the FIRs were lodged at about 15 p.m. in the Chandankiyari Police Station. Whereas FIR no. 104 was recorded against the appellants under Sections 147, 148, 149, 323, 324, 326, 307 and 302 of the Indian Indian Penal Code, 1860, 1860, FIR no. 105 was registered against the complainant party under Sections 147, 148, 149, 323, 324, 342, 448 and 354 of the Indian Indian Penal Code, 1860, 1860. 7. The case of the appellants as stated in the said FIR no. 105 lodged by the accused no. 5 is that the deceased had trespassed into his house and tried to outrage the modesty of Chinta Muni Majhian, wife of his younger brother and when she raised alarm, appellants tried to save her. The deceased, however, was armed with a tangi wherewith he assaulted on both 4 the appellants. He called all his family members who also were armed with lethal weapons. Appellants were assaulted causing injuries to them. The injuries sustained by the appellants Ravishwar Manjhi and Jaleshwar Manjhi were examined by the SHO Chandankiyari Police Station. He prepared injury reports of the appellants and sent them to the hospital for further treatment. 8. The injured, however, were sent to the private clinic of P.W. 11 - Dr. Ratan Kejriwal. Admittedly, at Chandankiyari there is a government hospital. It is also not in dispute that there is a hospital of Bharat Coking Coal Limited (BCCL), a public sector undertaking at Amlabad in which one of the injured witnesses was an employee. They, however, chose to go to village Chas which is at a distance of 22 kilometers from the place of occurrence and were admitted in the clinic of P.W. Post-mortem was conducted on 1997 at about 30 a.m. in the Sadar Hospital, Bokaro by Dr. Avinash Kumar Chaudhary (P.W. 12). The injuries observed by him in his post-mortem report on the deceased were as under: \"(i) incised wound 5\" x 1 =\" x cranial cavity deep on the left side of the forehead obliquely placed and extending to the right parietal region of the scalp with obvious commuted fracture of frontal bone on the left side; 5 (ii) Abrasion 2 =\" x 1 =\" over front of left shoulder wrist; (iii) Abrasion 1 =\" x =\" over left shoulder; (iv) Penetrating wound with sharp margins 1 =\" x The doctor had further observed that an iron rod with a spear shaped head with two spikes (tenta) was found stuck in the body which he had removed and handed over to the constable. In the opinion of the doctor, the death occurred due to injury no. (iv), which was caused by a sharp weapon and due to cardiac respiratory failure on account of the internal and external hemorrhage and injury to the vital organs like brain, kidney and intestine. Sengupta may be correct in his submission that the prosecution has not come out with the genesis of the occurrence. We also do not know as to why both the cases were not taken up by the same court one after the other. We furthermore fail to understand as to how a criminal case of 1999 is still pending in the Court of Judicial Magistrate, Bokaro. 15 17. The investigation was carried out in a slipshod manner. The FIR clearly showed that even before lodging of the FIR, investigation had started. The inquest was conducted, bloodstained grass and soil had been seized and the dead body was sent for post-mortem. 18. It is beyond anybody's comprehension that if the incident had taken place at about 2'O clock and it took about one and half hours for P.W. 17 to reach the village Simultand, how the FIR was recorded at about 45 p.m. while the inquest report was prepared at about 05 p.m. and blood stained grass and soil was seized at about 00 p.m. The injured persons received grievous injuries. It was expected that they would be rendered some medical help at the earliest. They were unconscious and, thus, they should have been sent for treatment to a nearby hospital. It was absolutely necessary that at least some medical help is rendered to them. They reached Dr. Kejriwal's Nursing Home at about 00 p.m. The following injuries were noticed by P.W.11, in his own words: \"On Gour Das I found following injuries: 16 1. Incised wound in left palm 9 cm x 1 cm cutting or superficial (illegible) 2. Abrasion on left shoulder joint. Aged within 6 hours. no. 1 by sharp instrument, 2nd by hard substance. no.1 grievous in nature and 2 simple. On Puran Chand Das found following injuries: 1. Lacerated wound on scalp 5 cm x 6 cm x . 5 cm avulsing on muscles. 2. Incised wound on (illegible) left scapula .10 cm x 2 cm. 3. Incised wound (illegible) left knee joint 8 cm x 10 cm. age within 6 hrs. Number one caused hard blunt object and another by sharp instrument. All the injuries are grievous the two injuries re in pen and signature Exh.4 and 4A. In response to all the relevant questions, his standard answer was \"I do not remember\". 19. If the prosecution case is correct that the dead body as also the injured persons were brought to the referral hospital, the same having been found to be closed, the injured were admitted in the Nursing Home, there was no reason as to why a police personnel did not accompany them. It is also strange that neither the exact location of injury on the head of the Puran Das 17 was stated nor description of the said injury had been furnished by the Doctor. He was also not in a position to say whether injury no. 3 was from the front or behind. According to him all injuries could be caused by similar weapons. He, in his injury report, even did not mention the colour of injury. 20. Whereas all the other prosecution witnesses were admitted in the hospital on the same day, P.W. 7 is said to have been admitted on the next day although he had suffered a grievous injury. It is not known whether he had been given any medical aid or not. Statement of none of the witnesses was recorded either on the day on which the occurrence had taken place or the day after. 21. P.W. 1 was examined after the `Shradh Ceremony' of deceased was over which would be about twelve days after the death. P.W. 3 stated that he was examined after one month. Statement of P.W. 7 was also taken after he was discharged from hospital, i.e. , at least after a week. The Investigating Officer in a case of this nature should have been examined. Unfortunately, even no site plan was prepared. There is nothing on record to show as to the exact place where 18 the occurrence had taken place. It is stated that the house of the parties is divided by a road. If that be so, it was all the more necessary to pin point the exact place of occurrence to ascertain who was the aggressor. No doubt, a life is lost and two persons suffered grievous injuries but we must also notice the injuries suffered by two of the appellants as was disclosed by Dr. Virendra Kumar (D.W. 2) in his evidence. \"On 1997 I was posted at M.O. at Chandankiyari. On that day at 30 p.m. I examined Ravishwar Manjhi s/o Berga Manjhi P.S.Chandankiyari, District Bokaro and found following injuries: 1) Incised wound 1 =\" x 1/6\" x 1/6\" over left palm ventrally below (illegible) of thumb by sharp cutting substance. 2) Scratches at four places over both sides of back and upper portions due to sharp cutting instrument 6\" and 5\" 3) Incised wound at two places over right palm posteriorly 4\" x =\" x 1\" deep and 2\" x The injuries being grievous in nature, the prosecution owed a duty to explain the same. Out of seven eyewitnesses, P.W. 7 was not believed by the courts below. P.Ws. 4 and 5 were not present exactly at the place of occurrence. They are said to have witnessed only a part of the occurrence. All other eyewitnesses were related to the deceased. However, we do not hesitate to add that only on that ground their evidences should not be disbelieved. Furthermore, there was no enmity between the parties. Even in respect thereof, no documentary evidence was brought on record to show as to when the said proceeding was initiated and at whose instance. The prosecution witnesses merely supported the prosecution case 20 that a death had taken place and two witnesses suffered grievous injuries but it was absolutely necessary in the facts and circumstances of this case to show that the accused were the aggressors. It was for that reason the genesis of the prosecution case must be held to have grave significance. The very fact that the appellants had gone back to their house to come out with arms and caused injuries on the person of the deceased and injured persons may or may not be correct, but even accepting the prosecution case to be correct, evidently the prosecution party also went to their house and brought weapons from their house. If it is accepted that the appellants were armed with such deadly weapons, it must also be accepted that the prosecution witnesses would also be armed with such weapons. It is, inter alia, for this reason the production of `Sanha' entry was necessary. We are not oblivious of the fact that a mere information received on phone by a Police Officer without any details as regards the identity of the accused or the nature of injuries caused by the victims as well as the name of the culprits may not be treated as FIR, but had the same been produced, the nature of information received by the police officer would have been clear. It is interesting to note that the High Court in its judgment recorded the following: \"The explanation given by the prosecution witnesses that they could not notice the injuries, if 21 any, on the person of the above named appellants on account of the fact that they themselves had sustained injuries and one of their own having sustained fatal injuries had died at the spot and the assault continued hardly for less than five minutes whereafter the assailants had fled away, appears to be a reasonable explanation as far as the injured witnesses are concerned. This, however, does not apply to the other eye witnesses, since they had an opportunity to see the entire occurrence from the beginning to end. From the evidence adduced by the prosecution and that by the defence, it appears that both sides had indulged in a free fight with each other in course of which, members of both the parties had sustained injuries. In the FIR of the counter case instituted by the appellant Ravishwar Manjhi, a feeble attempt to explain the injuries found on the person of the members of the prosecution party has been made. It is contended that it was in exercise of right of private defence by the appellants while resisting the advances made by the deceased that some injuries may have been caused to the deceased and other members of his family. Whether the outraging of modesty of a female member of the family of the accused was the reason giving rise to the occurrence is a question which should have been considered. If that be so, it was for the prosecution to prove that attempt on the part of the appellants to cause injuries was not as a result of previous enmity but for a different purpose. If the allegations made in the FIR that the appellants were drunk was correct, it was obligatory on the part of the P.W. 17 and consequently the Investigating Officer to get the said fact established. Medical evidence does not suggest the same. This aspect of the matter was not brought to the notice of the Doctor treating the accused. There were, thus, two versions. Both 23 were probable and if that be so, the plea of exercise of right of private defence raised by the appellant deserved serious consideration. There was no material brought on records to show that the appellants were the aggressors. If everything had happened within a short span of time as is alleged by the prosecution, namely, the appellants were causing nuisance which was objected to by the deceased; they went to their respective houses; came armed and started assaulting the deceased and other injured persons, it was also necessary for the prosecution to prove as to how accused persons received injuries. The places where the injuries had been inflicted also assume significance. If the prosecution witnesses are to be believed, the first injury was caused on hand. It was thereafter injuries were caused on other parts of the person of the prosecution witnesses and the last injury was caused by `tenta'.", "statute": ["s1"]}, "2003.INSC.590.txt": {"doc_url": "http://www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/2003/590.html", "explanation": {"Laxmansingh, Piyarsingh, Ghansi, Mansingh Narain and Hemraj sustained injuries.": ["s1"], "Deceased Hemraj was seriously injured.": ["s1"], "The accused persons also claimed to have sustained injuries and were also examined.": ["s1"], "Further, merely because the accused persons have sustained minor injuries as is evident from doctor's evidence, that does not in any manner affect the prosecution version.": ["s1"], "So far as relationship of eyewitnesses, that they being interested and/or the so-called familiarity with the deceased it does not render per se their evidence suspect.": ["s1"]}, "fact": " In a nutshell the prosecution case as unfolded during trial is as follows: On 1987 at about 00 p.m. informant Laxmansingh, Piyarsingh, Mansingh, Ghansi, Ratan, Machan Singh, Madan and Lalu had gone to the house of Hemraj Mina (hereinafter referred to as 'deceased') for participation in a Bhajan on the festival of Dol-Gyaras. After participating in the Bhajan programme all of them were returning to their village. While returning as such, they were required to go through a road which passes nearby the house of accused- appellant Shriram Jat. The moment they reached in front of his house, all the accused persons and their associates including some women assaulted and caused injuries to complainant party by lathi and stones. One Ratan escaped and went to Sarpanch Dulasingh and came along with him in a jeep. Laxmansingh, Piyarsingh, Ghansi, Mansingh Narain and Hemraj sustained injuries. Deceased Hemraj was seriously injured. Information was lodged at the police station and injured witnesses were examined. The accused persons also claimed to have sustained injuries and were also examined. Further, merely because the accused persons have sustained minor injuries as is evident from doctor's evidence, that does not in any manner affect the prosecution version. So far as relationship of eyewitnesses, that they being interested and/or the so-called familiarity with the deceased it does not render per se their evidence suspect.

Khatra.

Madhusudan Singha Mahapatra fell down on the land and thereafter, P.W. 2 with the help of the other villages brought his father and mother to the police station.

It was alleged that the accused Ram Samujh and Mahmood fired four shots, as a result of which the deceased fell down injured and thereafter Khaliq snatched the licensed revolver belonging to the deceased and all the five fled away from the scene. Ram Singh died on the spot. The incident of murderous attack was witnessed by Jaikirat Singh (P.W.1) who is none other than the son of deceased Ram Singh, Ram Ratan (P.W.2), resident of village Sujerpur hamlet of Bodipur and Ram Adhar (P.W.3). P.W.1 lodged written First Information Report Ext. Ka.1 on the same day at 45 p.m. naming all the accused and the manner in which the murderous attack on the deceased had taken place. Jagdamba Prasad Dwivedi (P.W.7) the office in-charge of Police station, Kothi rushed to the scene of offence at about 00 p.m. and found the dead body of Ram Singh and his motorcycle in galiyara near the fields of Ram Sewak Ahir. The broken pieces of the skull of the deceased and broken three teeth were seized from the place of occurrence. The discharged cartridge and tickli were also seized from the spot. P.W.7 after preparing the Inquest Report (Ext. Ka.7) sent the dead body for conducting post- mortem. Dr. R.S. Katiyar P.W.5 performed the autopsy on the dead body on 20th February, 1977 at about 45 a.m. and found as many as five ante-mortem gun shot wounds. A cap of cartridge was extricated from the brain of the deceased. Scalp bones were found fractured. It was found that vital organs like peritoneum, liver, kidneys were badly ruptured. In the opinion of the doctor, the cause of death was due to shock and hemorrhage resulting from ante-mortem injuries. The investigation of the case was transferred in the first week of March, 1977 to CBCID. Inspector M.L. Gautam having completed rest of the investigation submitted chargesheet against the appellants and other accused. The accused have denied the charges framed against them and took the plea that they have been falsely implicated due to enmity. The accused were accordingly put on trial. Therefore, in our view, the first information report was sent to the magistrate with reasonable promptitude and no delay at all was caused in forwarding the same to the magistrate. In any view of the matter, even if magistrates court was closed by and the first information report reached him within six hours from the time of its lodgement, in view of the increase in work load, we have no hesitation in saying that even in such a case it cannot be said that there was any delay at all in forwarding the first information report to the magistrate. It is not possible to lay down any universal rule as to within what time the special report is required to be despatched by the Station House officer after recording the FIR. It is in the evidence of Jaikirath Singh (P.W.1) that he rushed to the police station by a bicycle and lodged written FIR Ext. Ka.1 within 1 = hours of the incident. The distance between the place of occurrence and the police station is about 9 kms. It is in his evidence that he took about 15-20 minutes to prepare his report and nobody advised him in preparation of the report. He went to the police station all alone. We do not find any reason whatsoever to disbelieve this version given by PW There is nothing unnatural and unusual in PW 1 stating the details of the incident in his written FIR Ext. Ka. From a bare reading of the FIR Ext. Ka.1 we do not find anything artificial in it. It cannot be said to be a contrived one brought into existence after due deliberations as contended by the counsel for the appellant. Be it noted, Jagdamba Prasad Dwivedi, PW 7, the officer in-charge of police station, Kothi having received the relevant papers in village Sethmau, rushed to the place of occurrence and reached there at about 00 p.m. where he found the dead body of Ram Singh. The inquest report Ext. Ka.7 was prepared on the spot and the body was sent for post-mortem examination. The Inquest Report Ext. Ka.7 specifically refers to the lodging of FIR by PW 1 at 45 p.m. on The mere fact that crime number is not mentioned in the Inquest Report is of no significance. The sequence of events, namely, that Jagdamba Prasad Dwivedi -PW 7 reached the scene of offence at 00 p.m. and prepared Inquest Report duly mentioning about lodging of the FIR by PW 1 at 45 p.m. on 19th February, 1977 followed by despatch of the dead body to the hospital which reached the hospital by 30 p.m. and the post-mortem examination at 30 a.m. on 20th February, 1977 in clear and unequivocal terms reveal that the FIR was lodged at the time it is stated to have been recorded. It cannot be treated as an ante- timed and ante-dated one. It is required to note that 20th February, 1977 being Sunday, the Illaqua Magistrate received special report on 21st February, The special report was despatched by dak. Arrest of one Maiku Bhujwa on 19th February, 1977 at 00 p.m. in Crime no.17 under Section 147 etc. and his being lodged in police station at about 30 p.m. by two constables Ram Naresh and Ram Tool Misra as shown in Exts. Ka. 3 and 4 has been used as a sheet anchor to challenge the time of FIR Ext. Ka.1 by saying that if the two constables were summoned by Station Officer, on reaching the place of occurrence, then in all probability Station Officer reached the place of occurrence by 00 p.m. even before the FIR was issued. Moreover, arrest of Maiku was not in connection with the murder in question, but was in connection with another case. Most importantly, what could have been the object behind delaying the time of occurrence of reaching Sri Dwivedi, on the spot, has not been made clear by Sri Kidwai. We are of the view that arrest of Maiku at about 00 p.m. and his lodging in Hawalat at 30 p.m. by two constables, does not militate against the time of FIR Ext. Ka-1 as shown in police papers. It is also possible that some manipulation was made in the context of the arrest of Maiku, to make the case against him more sound. However, in order to satisfy ourselves we have looked into the evidence of PWs 1,2,3 and 7 and we are satisfied that the FIR was lodged on the date and time as stated by the prosecution. The prosecution story entirely rests upon the direct evidence of PW Nos. 1, 2 and PW-1 is none other than the son of deceased Ram Singh. He was present in his fields situated nearby the place of occurrence where his father was attacked. Jaikirat (PW-1) no doubt was doing his part time G.N.S. in plantation at Lucknow but that itself would not make his presence doubtful at the scene of offence on the fateful day. There is nothing unnatural about the conduct of PW-1 at the scene of occurrence. He gave detailed version as to the manner of assault and the role played by each of the accused. The names of PW-2 and PW-3 were also mentioned as eye-witnesses in the First Information Report itself. In the circumstances, PW-2 and PW-3 cannot be treated as chance witnesses. It is in the evidence of Jaikirat (PW-1) that all the four shots were fired in quick succession and at that moment PW-1 was at some distance from the actual place of attack. Be it noted that at least 2 accused were armed with fire-arms and one with lathi and they were using the weapons with all impunity. In such circumstances, Jaikirat (PW-1) may not have mustered his courage to jump into the fray and risk his own life. It is very difficult to predict or express any opinion as to what could have been normal or natural conduct of a person in such a situation. Response of individuals in such situations may differ from person to person. The post-mortem examination of the deceased Ram Singh was performed by Dr. R.S.Katiyar (PW-5). The post-mortem report is exhibit Ka- The Medical Officer found the following ante-mortem injuries on the person of the deceased: 1. A gun shot wound (wound of entry) 3 cm x 1 cm. Over left side of face just above the left side of the lower lip. Wound of Ext. 3 cm x 2 cm. Over the right parietal bone, 7 cm. Above the right ear. 2. A gun shot wound 5 cm x 1 cm. Over the right side of face below max. prominence. 3. Multiple gun shot wounds in an area of 13 cm x 11 cm. Over the right side of back below the inferior angle of scapula. 4. A gun shot wound (wound of entry) 2 cm x 2 cm over the right side of the back 2 cm. Right to 12th thoracic vertebra. 5. Multiple gun shot wounds in an area of 9 cm. X 4 cm. Over the back and middle of right arm. The Medical Officer is not ballistic expert. He was not expected to answer as to whether injury no. 1 could have been caused by bullet alone. His opinion to that extent is of no consequence. It is required to be noticed that Ram Smujh (A-1) who had fired two shots, convicted by the Sessions Court, did not even challenge his conviction in the High Court. PW-5 in his evidence stated that all the injuries sustained by the deceased were from gun. It is further stated that from the body of deceased one bullet, one cover tikli, two dat and 40 chare shots were taken out, put in packet and sealed .It is also stated in his evidence that injuries caused on the body of the deceased were sufficient in the normal course to cause death. This part of the medical evidence if juxtaposed with the oral evidence of PW-1, 2 and 3 it becomes unnecessary to go into the question as to which accused caused what injury and which was a fatal one. The common object of the unlawful assembly of the accused in the present case is evident from the fact that some of them were armed with deadly weapons.", "statute": ["s1"]}, "1996.INSC.246.txt": {"doc_url": "http://www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/1996/246.html", "explanation": {"When he reached near the junction of sectionV.": ["s1"], "Road and Gaothan lane no.1, he was attacked by a crowd of about 10 to 12 persons, including the 8 accused and some injuries were caused to him.": ["s1"], "Afzal saw the assault on his friend and run to his rescue.": ["s1"], "On seeing Afzal approaching them the assailants turned their attention towards Afzal and assaulted him with the weapons which they were carrying.": ["s1"], "Afzal received number of injuries,became giddy and fell down in the nearby gutter.": ["s1"], "Meanwhile, Bodha started running towards his house.": ["s1"], "Appellant no.1 had an open knife in his hand and appellant no.2 was armed with a big iron 'zara' (a utensil with many holes, ordinarily used by cooks and confectioners).": ["s1"], "Bodha pushed open the front door of his house, crossed the first room, went into the second room and while he was trying to open the door of kitchen, appellants Nos.1 and 2 who had followed him right inside his house, assaulted him again.": ["s1"], "Appellant no.1 gave a knife blow on the chest of Bodha and Appellant no.2 gave a 'zara' blow on his head.": ["s1"], "Bodha fell down at that very spot as a result of the injuries received by him.": ["s1"], "Appellant Nos. 3 and 6 who had also chased Bodha did not enter the house but remained standing outside abusing Bodha and uttering threats When Kuldip Kaur, sister of Bodha and Rajinder Singh went near the door, appellant no.6 asked them to bring Bodha out as he wanted to take revenge as Bodha had some days before the date of the incident beaten them.": ["s1"], "On Kuldip Kaur informing them that Bodha had received serious injuries and had become unconscious, appellant Nos.3 to 6 also ran away.": ["s1"], "Though there is no evidence to show what actually prompted the appellants and acquitted accused Nos.7 and 8 to cause the death of Bodha on that day, evidence of Kuldip Kaur (PW2) and Rabinder Singh (PW4) discloses that Appellant Nos.": ["s1"], "3 to 6 were abusing Bodha and uttering threats and Appellant no.": ["s1"], "6, Yasin, was shouting that he wanted to take revenge against Bodha as Bodha had assaulted them previously.": ["s1"], "It is also not in dispute that there was sufficient light at the said place.": ["s1"], "The evidence of Harbinder Singh (PW5) that in the crowd of 12 persons which attacked his brother Bodha and Afzal he had seen the appellants has remanded unshaken.": ["s1"], "It was possible for this witness to identify the appellants as they were all known to him since his childhood.": ["s1"], "His explanation regarding his presence at that time has been accepted by both the courts below and his evidence on that point has also remained unshaken.": ["s1"], "This witness had no reason to falsely involve the appellants and let go the real assailants.": ["s1"], "The versions of witnesses Harbinder Singh and Afzal that during the first part of the incident Bodha was given only `zara' and fist bless cannot be considered as improbable or unnatural.": ["s1"], "On seeing Bodha near the junction of the lane the assailants ran towards him.": ["s1"], "Bodha must have not remained stationary.": ["s1"], "If under these circumstances no injury was caused to Bodha at that time by a weapon like a knife or razor.": ["s1"], "it cannot be said that on the ground of improbability or unnaturalness their evidence should have been discarded.": ["s1"], "The evidence of witness Muneshwar (P.W.7) discloses that the iron zaras were removed from the rear portion of his shop which is near the place of the incident after he had closed it at about 30 P.M.": ["s1"], "As the High Court has pointed out, apars from the evidence of the eye- witnesses the evidence of Ratan Lal Jain and the investigating Officer and also the Panchnama of the scene of offence (Exhibit 47) discloses that there was a pool of blood in the second room.": ["s1"], "The witness has explained that it all happened suddenly and when Bodha came running inside the house he was reading a book.": ["s1"], "Thus. there was hardly any time before he could have intervened.": ["s1"], "Though Appellant Nos.": ["s1"], "3 to 6 had not carried weapons when they had chased Bodha their conduct in uttering threats and challenging Bodha to come out so that they could take revenge is indicative of the fact that they were all acting in prosecution of their common object.": ["s1"]}, "fact": " Harbhajan Singh alias Bodha for whose murder the appellants have been convicted was residing at Arthur Villa situated at a distance of about 20 feet from the junction of Gaothan lane no.l and Swami Vivekanand Road (S.V. Road). sectionV. Road in the main road running through Andheri, a suburb of Bombay. and Gaothan lane Nos.1, 2 and 3 are its lanes. Gaothan lane no.2 where accused Nos.1, 3, 4, 6 and acquitted accused Nos.7 and 8 were residing is about 30 feet away from Gaothan lane no. Gaothan lane no.2 wherein accused Nos. 2 and 5 were residing is little ahead of Gaothan lane no. Bodha was residing with his widowed mother Surjit Kaur and five brothers, namely (1) Sukhwinder Singh, (2) Rajinder Singh, (3) Harbinder Singh, (4) Jitender Singh and (5) Surender Singh. Bodha had a friend named Afzal, who was earlier residing in Arthur Villa but later on shifted to Varsova, a nearby suburb. On 1977, at about 7 P.M. Afzal left his house at Varsova and went to Andheri to meet his married sister. Then at about 9 P.M. he went to Golden Gate Restaurant situated on sectionV. Road. Bodha met him there, They remained there till some time before 11 P.M. As Afzal wanted to catch the last bus leaving Andheri for Varsova at about 05 P.M. , they left the restaurant and came near the bus stop which was in between Gaothan lanes no.1 and 2 on sectionV. Road. Afzal stopped at the bus stop and Bodha proceeded further towards his house. When he reached near the junction of sectionV. Road and Gaothan lane no.1, he was attacked by a crowd of about 10 to 12 persons, including the 8 accused and some injuries were caused to him. Afzal saw the assault on his friend and run to his rescue. On seeing Afzal approaching them the assailants turned their attention towards Afzal and assaulted him with the weapons which they were carrying. Afzal received number of injuries,became giddy and fell down in the nearby gutter. Meanwhile, Bodha started running towards his house. Accused-appellants Nos.1 to 6 ran after him. Appellant no.1 had an open knife in his hand and appellant no.2 was armed with a big iron 'zara' (a utensil with many holes, ordinarily used by cooks and confectioners). Bodha pushed open the front door of his house, crossed the first room, went into the second room and while he was trying to open the door of kitchen, appellants Nos.1 and 2 who had followed him right inside his house, assaulted him again. Appellant no.1 gave a knife blow on the chest of Bodha and Appellant no.2 gave a 'zara' blow on his head. The two appellants then ran away from there. Bodha fell down at that very spot as a result of the injuries received by him. Appellant Nos. 3 and 6 who had also chased Bodha did not enter the house but remained standing outside abusing Bodha and uttering threats When Kuldip Kaur, sister of Bodha and Rajinder Singh went near the door, appellant no.6 asked them to bring Bodha out as he wanted to take revenge as Bodha had some days before the date of the incident beaten them. On Kuldip Kaur informing them that Bodha had received serious injuries and had become unconscious, appellant Nos.3 to 6 also ran away. Seeing the serious condition of her son, Surjit Kaur sent her younger son Surender Singh to call her brother Harbans Singh who was residing close by. Harbans Singh on being informed bout the incident immediately contacted the police control room. The control room informed the mobile police van moving in that area. P.S.I. Nanaware who was the incharge of the mobile van reached Arthur Villa within 5 to 6 minutes. Finding the condition of Bodha serious, he removed Bodha with some of his family members in the van to Cooper hospital. The Doctor who examined Bodha found him dead. So he informed police constable Kadam who was on duty about Bodha's death. Constable Kadam sent a telephone message to Andheri Police Station. Within a short time the investigation started. Accused Nos. 3 to 6 were taken into custody at about 5 A.M. Accused Nos. 1 and 2 were arrested on 1977 and Accused Nos. 7 and 8 were arrested on May All the appellants and acquitted accused Nos.7 and 8 were tried by the learned Additional Sessions Judge. Greater Bombay, in Sessions Case no.207 of 1977 for the offences punishable under Sections 147, 302 read with 307 read with 149, 449 read with 149 and 450 read with 149 of the Indian Indian Penal Code, 1860, 1860. In the alternative they were also charged under Sections 307 read with 34 and 302 read with 34 Indian Penal Code, 1860. Appellant Nos. 1 to 6 were also charged under Sections 450 both read with Section 34 Indian Penal Code, 1860. The learned Additional Sessions Judge convicted all the accused for the offences with which they were charged. Though there is no evidence to show what actually prompted the appellants and acquitted accused Nos.7 and 8 to cause the death of Bodha on that day, evidence of Kuldip Kaur (PW2) and Rabinder Singh (PW4) discloses that Appellant Nos. 3 to 6 were abusing Bodha and uttering threats and Appellant no. 6, Yasin, was shouting that he wanted to take revenge against Bodha as Bodha had assaulted them previously. It is not in dispute that assault on Bodha and Afzal took place near the junction of the lane with the sectionV. Road. It is also not in dispute that there was sufficient light at the said place. The evidence of Harbinder Singh (PW5) that in the crowd of 12 persons which attacked his brother Bodha and Afzal he had seen the appellants has remanded unshaken. It was possible for this witness to identify the appellants as they were all known to him since his childhood. His explanation regarding his presence at that time has been accepted by both the courts below and his evidence on that point has also remained unshaken. This witness had no reason to falsely involve the appellants and let go the real assailants. The versions of witnesses Harbinder Singh and Afzal that during the first part of the incident Bodha was given only `zara' and fist bless cannot be considered as improbable or unnatural. On seeing Bodha near the junction of the lane the assailants ran towards him. Bodha must have not remained stationary. Therefore, it all depended upon which of the assailants were able to reach him first. Moreover, when they saw Afzal rushing towards them, they left Bodha and started beating him. If under these circumstances no injury was caused to Bodha at that time by a weapon like a knife or razor. it cannot be said that on the ground of improbability or unnaturalness their evidence should have been discarded. The evidence of witness Muneshwar (P.W.7) discloses that the iron zaras were removed from the rear portion of his shop which is near the place of the incident after he had closed it at about 30 P.M. As the High Court has pointed out, apars from the evidence of the eye- witnesses the evidence of Ratan Lal Jain and the investigating Officer and also the Panchnama of the scene of offence (Exhibit 47) discloses that there was a pool of blood in the second room. The witness has explained that it all happened suddenly and when Bodha came running inside the house he was reading a book. Thus. there was hardly any time before he could have intervened. Though Appellant Nos. 3 to 6 had not carried weapons when they had chased Bodha their conduct in uttering threats and challenging Bodha to come out so that they could take revenge is indicative of the fact that they were all acting in prosecution of their common object.", "statute": ["s1"]}, "2009.INSC.268.txt": {"doc_url": "http://www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/2009/268.html", "explanation": {"Accused Banne alias Baijnath and Binne alias Viswanath were armed with iron 7 rods while the other accused Nanhe alias Narain, Bhola and Ramji were armed with sticks.": ["s1"], "Thereupon the accused Banne alias Baijnath instigated other accused persons to assault Tilakdhari and his father and drive them away": ["s1"], "The accused Ramji gave a lathi blow to Amardhari who consequently fell down because of the impact of blow.": ["s3", "s1"], "Banne alias Baijnath gave a thrust with the iron rod in the abdomen which punctured the abdomen of Amardhari.": ["s1"], "Sahangoo was attacked by Ramji, Bhole and Nanhe with lathis.": ["s1"], "Tilakdhari PW1 was also given blows by the accused persons.

[2009] INSC 268 (10 February 2009)  Members of the accused and complainant party are close relatives.  1 In order to properly appreciate the relationship, the pedigree of the family is reproduced:  2 3 4 On 13.11.1977 a violent incident is alleged to have taken place betweenthe accused and members of the complainant party, namely, Moti, Gharroo and his sons over share in plot No.165/2 measuring 1.88 decimals situated in Village Shivpurwa, P.S. Manduadih, District Varanasi.  It is admitted case of the parties that Chhakkoo and his brother Panchu were original tenure holders of the said plot along with some other plots.  In a suit under Section 49 of the U.P. Tenancy Act, Moti, Gharroo and Lalloo obtained one half share in the joint Khata while the other half share went to descendants of Panchu, namely, Vinayak and others.  Lalloo, Moti and Gharroo have since been recorded as co-tenure holders of the aforesaid plot along with other plots.  The dispute about the share between Lalloo on the one hand and Gharroo and Moti on the other started in the year 5 1965.  Lalloo claimed one half share while according to Moti and Gharroo all the three daughters' sons Lalloo, Moti and Gharroo had equal share.  Lalloo took the lead in asserting his claim by executing a sale deed in respect of 5 decimals of plot No.251/2 area 10 decimals in favour of Shivlal on 21.1.1965.  He executed second sale deed in respect of 6 decimals of plot No.205/2 measuring 12 decimals in favour of Nand Lal and Lalloo sons of Dhanesh on 20.12.65.  Moti deposited ten times land revenue of his one-third share in the disputed joint Khata comprising of plots Nos.109, 165/2, 182/2, 205/2 and 251/2 and filed a suit for division of holdings under Section 138 of the Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act for 1/3rd share on 6.1.66.  The suit was decreed ex parte on 10.1.1970 and mutation of this order was made in Khatauni 1376 F to 1378F.  The ex-parte decree was, however, set aside on the application of Lalloo, father of the accused persons, after setting aside the ex parte decree on 19.2.1973.  Thereafter the suit was proceeded in the revenue court.  It was dismissed in default on 27.7.1977.  The suit was ultimately restored on 6 21.2.1979 on the application of Moti and decided in his favour on 25.2.80 against which the appeal has been filed by the accused persons which is still pending.  After the death of Lalloo, his five sons succeeded to the property.  According to the prosecution, the disputed plot No.165/2 is divided into two portions.  One-third portion towards north has been in possession of the accused persons  since the time of their father Lalloo while the two- third portion towards south is in the joint cultivation of Moti and Gharroo.  There is a Merh between the portion in the occupation of the accused and that in the possession of Moti and Gharroo.  On 13.11.1977 at about 7.00 a.m. Tilakdhari PW.1 and his father Gharroo went to their portion of the plot in dispute along with the bullocks to plough the land.  Immediately after they had started ploughing, all the accused persons arrived there.  Accused Banne alias Baijnath and Binne alias Viswanath were armed with iron 7 rods while the other accused Nanhe alias Narain, Bhola and Ramji were armed with sticks.  The accused persons asked Tilakdhari, PW1 and his father to get out of the field.  They refused to do so saying that the said portion of the field has been in their possession for a long time and that they would continue to plough it.  Thereupon the accused Banne alias Baijnath instigated other accused persons to assault Tilakdhari and his father and drive them away, whereupon Gharroo ran towards the house of Khatkhat in the neighbourhood.  Hearing the hue and cry raised on the spot, Amardhari, Shangoo and Jagga arrived at the spot.  The accused Ramji gave a lathi blow to Amardhari who consequently fell down because of the impact of blow.  Banne alias Baijnath gave a thrust with the iron rod in the abdomen which punctured the abdomen of Amardhari.  The intestine of Amardhari protruded out through the wound and he also fell down.  Sahangoo was attacked by Ramji, Bhole and Nanhe with lathis.  He received lacerated wounds on his head.  He ran towards the house of Sahdeo and fell 8 down at his doorstep.  Tilakdhari PW1 was also given blows by the accused persons.  The case of the accused persons is that the members of the complainant party tried to forcibly dispossess them and in their right of private defence some injuries were caused to the members of the complainant party.  Tilakdhari PW1 dictated a written report Ex. Ka. 1 to Sitaram on the spot.  He took Sahangoo, Amardhari to P.S.  Manduadih where he submitted the written report Ex. Ka.1, in terms of which chick FIR Ex. Ka. 13 was prepared and a case was registered in the general diary.  Sahangoo, Amardhari and Tilakdhari were escorted to S.S.P.G. Hospital,Varanasi, where they were examined for their injuries by Dr. A.K. Dwivedi at 8.45 A.M., 9.00 A.M. and 12.00 noon respectively.  Sahangoo succumbed to the injuries at 5.45 P.M. on the same day in S.S.P.G. Hospital, Varanasi and died.  Inquest of the dead body was performed 9 by Ram Chandra Pandey S.I. on 14.11.1977 at 8.00 A.M.  The trial court, on appraisal of evidence, came to the findings that at the time of incident the prosecution party was in peaceful possession of the land in question and with the dismissal of suit the accused persons came there forming an unlawful assembly to extend their possession over half share and interfered in the peaceful possession of Gharroo and Moti in the southern portion of the plot.

Party. He was also practicing as an Advocate at Jehanabad. On April 19, 1985 while he was proceeding to the Jehanabad Court in a jeep driven by him accompanied by seven other persons including his personal security officer, his jeep was attacked by a group of persons who were variously armed with guns, rifles, Pasuli etc. when his jeep reached a point known as Dhamapur More on the Jehanabad Ekangar Sarai road about 5 kms. from the police station. The case of the prosecution is that a shot fired by respondent Naresh Yadav hit him as a result of which the vehicle went out of control and landed in an agricultural field which was at a slightly lower level than the road. The occupants of the vehicle tried to escape but they were fired upon by the members of the mob as a result of which six of them died at the spot while two of them were seriously injured. The case of the prosecution is that the two injured victims were removed to the Jehanabad hospital where they succumbed to their injuries. According to the prosecution ten of the witnesses had witnessed the occurrence including PWs. 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8 and PWs. 4, 7 and 11 were tendered for cross-examination at the trial.

The post mortem reports were exhibited at the trial as exhibit 6 series. PW-12 Tufail Ahmad (officer incharge Ghosi police station) who had reached the place of occurrence at about 20 a.m. investigated the case and ultimately submitted the charge sheet against 13 respondents herein. We shall first of all notice the evidence of PW-12 Tufail Ahmad, the investigating officer, who had received an oral information at about 00 a.m. on April 19, 1985 that firing was going on near Dhamapur culvert, and he reached the place of occurrence at 20 a.m. with police force. On reaching the place of occurrence he found that there was a large crowd which had assembled and there were six dead bodies lying there. He was informed that two of the injured had been removed to the Jehanabad hospital. He also saw the jeep standing in the field towards north of the place of occurrence. He also saw the headless body of Keshari Nandan in the jeep. After reaching the place of occurrence he started preparing the inquest reports relating to the dead bodies. He had prepared five inquest reports between 30 a.m. and 45 a.m. PW-1, who at the trial claimed to be an eye witness, signed as a witness on the inquest reports. According to him by about 50 a.m. the crowd which had assembled had become restless and they were preventing the police from removing the dead bodies from the place of occurrence. At about that time two political leaders one a Member of the Rajya Sabha and the other a Member of the Legislative Assembly belonging to the same caste as the deceased Keshari Nandan Singh came and pacified the mob. There was a commotion while he was preparing the inquest reports and he learnt that the hut of respondent Naresh Yadav had been set on fire in Gulgulia Tola. He alongwith Deputy Superintendent of Police and the Inspector of Police, who had reached the place of occurrence by then rushed to the 'dalan' of respondent Naresh Yadav and found that the roof of the 'dalan' had been set on fire. After deputing Sub-Inspector N.K. Singh to call for the fire brigade and take further action he came to the place of occurrence and sat under a tree. At about 00 a.m. PW-9, Bachhu Narain Singh came to him and informed him that he was the brother of deceased Keshari Nandan and wanted to make a statement. He, therefore, recorded the statement of PW-9 at 00 a.m. which was marked as Ext. 4 on the basis of which formal first information report Ext. 5 was drawn up at the police station. He searched for the respondents but they were not found. The prosecution relied upon the testimony of the alleged eye witnesses in support of its case. Some other facts may be noticed at this stage. According to the first information report lodged by PW-9, while he was proceeding towards his pump house and was near the place of occurrence he had noticed the presence of 40 or 50 people including respondents 1 to 13 herein variously armed near the house of respondent Naresh Yadav. They were armed with rifles, guns and other weapons. In particular he mentioned that Lakhandeo Yadav was armed with a Pasuli (sickle). He noticed his brother's jeep coming from the eastern direction and proceeding towards the west on way to Jehanabad. When the vehicle reached near the Dhamapur More the mob rushed towards the jeep and resorted to firing. A shot fired by respondent Naresh Yadav struck the head of Mukhiya Keshari Nadan who was driving the jeep and as a result he lost control over the vehicle which came and fell in a field towards the north of the road. The members of the mob continued firing at the occupants of the jeep who were trying to escape. Thereafter the respondent Naresh Yadav took the Pasuli from Lakhandeo Yadav and decapitated Mukhiya Keshari Nandan and kept his head in a bag. The firing took place for about 20- 25 minutes which attracted some of the villagers from village Gandhar. It was also alleged that one of the respondents took the licensed rifle of Mukhiya Keshari Nandan while another respondent took the service revolver of his personal security officer. The culprits ran towards north except Lakhandeo Yadav, who after running towards north turned towards east and was apprehended by the villagers coming from village Gandhar. Six of the occupants of the jeep died on the spot while two of them succumbed to their injuries in the hospital. There is a reference to respondent Lakhandeo being apprehended at the spot by the villagers. But it appears that Lakhandeo had come to the place of occurrence later and was surrounded by the villagers and assaulted by them at about 00 a.m. The defence of Lakhandeo was that one of the victims Rama Nand Yadav was his cousin as well as co-brother. Coming to know about the occurrence he had rushed to the place of occurrence to know about his cousin and co-brother and there he was apprehended by the villagers who had assembled there and who assaulted him. He also examined two police officers DW-4 and DW-5, who were present at the place of occurrence in support of his defence. The case of the defence is that the prosecution witnesses were got up witnesses who had not witnessed the actual occurrence. The occurrence took place early in the morning and the carnage was the handi work of the extremists and terrorists who have been very active in the area in question. The respondents had no motive to commit such a gruesome crime taking the lives of as many as eight persons. The mere fact that there was some political rivalry between followers of the Congress Party and the Communist Party, was not a good enough reason for them to commit such a gruesome crime. Relying upon the evidence adduced at the trial by the prosecution itself it was contended that none of the persons present at the place of occurrence claimed to be an eye witness when the officer incharge of the Ghosi police station came there at 20 a.m. He prepared inquest reports between 30 a.m. and 45 a.m. but no one approached him claiming to be an eye witnesections Two political figures belonging to the Congress Party came to the place of occurrence and it appears that only thereafter a false case was concocted against the respondents since the culprits were unknown and since the respondents were not the supporters of the Congress Party but had supported the Communist candidate in the elections to the Legislative Assembly held in the month of March. It was further submitted on behalf of the defence that all the alleged eye witnesses belonged to the same caste, namely the caste of Mukhiya Keshari Nandan. Moreover none of them was examined by the investigating officer on the date of occurrence. Some of them were examined one or two days later and one of them was not examined at all in the course of investigation. The Special Report was also seen by the jurisdictional Magistrate for the first time on April 22, This only indicated that the first information report was concocted later after deliberations. They also pointed out the discrepancies in the statements of the witnesses recorded in the course of investigation and their depositions in courts. After noticing the evidence of the alleged eye witnesses and the investigating officer, PW-12, he came to the conclusion that Fardbeyan appears to have been lodged within 2 = hours of the occurrence, but there is no plausible explanation as to why the report was not lodged by any of the eye witnesses after the investigating officer had reached the place of occurrence at 20 a.m. He was there at the spot preparing inquest reports between 30 a.m. and 45 a.m. and yet no one claimed before him to be an eye witnesections It was only at 00 a.m. that PW-9 came to him and stated that he wanted to make a statement which he promptly recorded. He also found that the defence of Lakhandeo that he was not caught while running away from the place of occurrence but when he came to the place of occurrence much later on coming to know that his cousin was also one of the victims was true. He was apprehended by the mob but was got released from their clutches by the police officers there. It was also found that though the first information report was registered on April 19, 1985 but first order recorded in the concerned G.R. case record is dated April 22, However, he did not attach much importance to this delay since he was satisfied that the information was given by PW-9 to the investigating officer at 00 a.m. As regards motive he found that though no such motive was mentioned in the Fardbeyan, Ext.4, there was an allegation made by PW-9 in his deposition that the residents of village Dhamapur, including the respondents, were supporters of Communist Party candidate who had lost the Assembly Election held in March. Since a victory procession had been taken out headed by Mukhiya Keshari Nandan 10 15 days prior to the date of incident to which they were strongly opposed, they had taken revenge by killing Mukhiya Kehsari Nandan. He noticed that all the witnesses belonged to the same caste and to the same village. No eye witness was examined who belonged to the village where the occurrence took place. According to the case of the prosecution the eye witnesses were present when the occurrence took place yet none of them claimed to be an eye witness when the investigating officer came to the place of occurrence. That apart, none of them was examined by the investigating officer on the date of occurrence. Some were examined on the following day and some still later and one of them, PW-8, was not at all examined in the course of investigation. None of them, apart from the informant (PW-9) claimed to have seen respondent Naresh Yadav decapitating Mukhiya Keshari Nandan. The evidence also disclosed that though an allegation had been made that one of the accused had taken away the licensed revolver of Mukhiya Keshari Nandan after the occurrence, PW-9 in the course of his deposition had to admit that the licensed revolver of Mukhiya Keshari Nandan was found under his pillow during investigation. In fact from the evidence of the investigating officer it appeared that during the course of investigation some of the witnesses had stated that the culprits included some persons dressed in khaki which is usually worn by the extremists to create an impression that they belong to the police force. Having found their testimony to be not credible and trust worthy and having regard to other findings, he came to the conclusion that the prosecution had not proved its case beyond reasonable doubt. In the first instance there appears to be no reason why no one stated before the investigating officer who came to the place of occurrence at 20 a.m. that he had witnessed the occurrence as an eye witnesections Since they claimed to be eye witnesses and large number of persons had gathered at the place of occurrence when the investigating officer reached that place with police force, the normal course of human conduct would have been, for any of the eye witnesses to immediately inform the investigating officer that he had witnessed the occurrence. We fail to understand why from 30 a.m. till 45 a.m. , while the investigating officer was preparing inquest reports no one came before him claiming to be an eye witnesections The most interesting part of the story is the role of PW- 1, Ramji Singh. He is a witness to the inquest report and obviously he was present when the investigating officer was preparing the inquest reports. He also claims to be an eye witness and has deposed as such. One fails to understand why he could not tell the investigating officer that he himself was an eye witnesections This was sought to be got over by an argument that the villagers must have been shocked by the ghastly incident and therefore they did not make such a statement before the investigating officer. If PW-1 could be a witness to the inquest reports which were being prepared on the spot, there is no reason why he could not be the first informant in the case. It has not been disputed and could not be disputed that the investigating officer came to the place of occurrence at 20 a.m. If the alleged eye witnesses were present, and there are as many as 10 of them, there is no reason why none of them came forward to lodge the report about the occurrence. PW-9, the informant was a brother of the deceased Mukhiya Keshari Nandan. If he had seen the occurrence, nothing prevented him from lodging the report immediately. He appears to have come on the scene more than an hour and a half after the investigating officer had come to the place of occurrence. The fact that the report was lodged within 2 = hours of the occurrence and was, therefore, not unduly delayed does not explain why it was not lodged earlier in the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case. The case of the prosecution is that Lakhandeo respondent was one of the culprits and he also ran towards north alongwith all his companions. He, however, changed course and started running in a different direction only to be apprehended by the villagers coming from the side of village Gandhar. This story of the prosecution has been found to be untrue and for good reasons. As the High Court has observed, if really Lakhandeo had been apprehended by the villagers before the arrival of the police force he would have been immediately handed over to the police force if he had not been lynched earlier by the mob. This apart, there is direct evidence of two police officers who were present at the place of occurrence alongwith the investigating officer. They are DW-4 and DW-5, who were Inspector and Sub-Inspector of police respectively. They have deposed that at about 00 a.m. i.e. after one hour of the lodging of the report, there was a commotion and they found that one person was being assaulted by the villagers. They went to the rescue of that villager and found that the victim was Lakhandeo. Lakhandeo has pleaded that having come to know that his cousin, who also happens to be his co-brother may be one of the victims, he had rushed to the place of occurrence to find out about his welfare. However, when he came to the place of occurrence he was surrounded by the villagers and assaulted till he was rescued by the police party. The High Court has found that this part of the prosecution case is untrue and the defence of Lakhandeo appears to be truthful. Similarly, PW-9 in the report had stated that the revolver of Mukhiya Keshari Nandan had been taken away by one of the accused. However, in the course of his deposition he had to admit that the revolver of Mukhiya Keshari Nandan was found under his pillow in the course of investigation.", "statute": ["s1"]}, "2007.INSC.142.txt": {"doc_url": "http://www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/2007/142.html", "explanation": {"The trial Court indicated that the root cause of the quarrel was refusal to exchange copper vessel (Kolaga) to Nagraj, winner of the draw, but he was not examined.": ["s1"], "Though it is in evidence that Accused no.": ["s1"], "1 Chandrappa was injured and was also taken to the hospital alongwith Anjaninappa, some witnesses had denied the fact as to injuries sustained by the Accused no.": ["s1"], "In our view, the submission of the learned counsel for the appellants is well founded that it is not material whether Accused no.": ["s1"], "1 had or had not filed a complaint or he was or was not examined by a doctor, but the fact that even though it was the case of prosecution that Accused no.": ["s1"], "1 was injured during the course of incident, prosecution witnesses tried to suppress that fact which would throw doubt as to the correctness of the case or the manner in which the incident had happened.": ["s1"], "The trial Court had also stated that it was unnatural that the prosecution witnesses and deceased Anjaninappa could have gone to Hanumanthapura Bypass at about 30 p.m.": ["s1"], "when a shorter route was available for going to their destination.": ["s1"], "The trial Court observed that there was inconsistency in prosecution evidence as to availability of electric light at the time of incident.": ["s1"], "The Court also noted that the knife produced before the Court as mudamal article was not the same which was used by Accused no. 8 for inflicting injury on the deceased.

It is the case of the prosecution that on October 30, 1989, one such transaction was held at about 30 p.m. in which one Nagaraj, the successful bidder was given a copper vessel (Kolaga). Nagaraj returned the vessel with his maternal uncle as it was old and demanded a new vessel. But the request was refused by the proprietors of the Chit Transaction. It is further the prosecution case that at about 30 p.m. on the same day, i.e. October 30, 1989, near Hanumanthapura Bypass, when PW1 Veerabhadraiah along with PWs 2, 3 and 4 (Chikkanna, Rudramurthy and Puttiah) was proceeding, the Accused Nos. 1 to 8 who had formed themselves into an unlawful assembly and were armed with weapons like, knife, reapers and stones attacked PWs 2 to The accused caused injuries to all the three persons. It is alleged that when the quarrel was going on and PWs 2 to 4 were injured, deceased Anjinappa came forward and intervened and went ahead to stop the quarrel. Accused no. 8 Thammaiah took out a button knife from his pocket and stabbed Anjinappa on the left side of his chest, due to which Anjinappa slumped and fell on the ground. Complainant Veerabhadraiah along with one Krishnaiah, s/o Oblaiah carried Anjinappa in an autorickshaw to the hospital. On the way to hospital, Anjinappa breathed his last. The dead body of Anjinappa was then taken to the General Hospital, Tumkur. The accused persons after committing assault, threw the clubs and rippers at the spot and ran away. At about 30 p.m. , PW 13 Madhukar Musale, Circle Inspector of Police, Tumkur received an information about the incident of rioting that took place at Hanumanthapura. On being intimated by PSI, PW 7 A.R. Shariff about the rioting and the injured being admitted to General Hospital at Tumkur, PW 13 went to the hospital and learnt that Anjinappa had died and the other three injured persons were taking treatment. It is alleged that PW 1, Veerabhadraiah, who was present in the hospital, was questioned by PW The information given by him was recorded in writing as per exhibit P-1 as complaint and was registered as Crime no. 86 of 1989 for offences punishable Sections 143, 147, 148, 324 and 302 read with Section 149 Indian Penal Code, 1860. Accused no. 7 Tukaraiah died during the pendency of the case and the trial abated against him. Inquest over the dead body of deceased Anjinappa was done and the dead body was sent for post-mortem examination. PW 11 Dr. Hanumakka who conducted the postmortem opined that the injuries were ante mortem in nature. She found a punctured wound over the left 3rd inter costal space extending from medial edge of the areola of left nipple obliquely downwards and medially 2\" x 2\" size with clean cut margin and fat protruding through the wound the depth of which was 3= inches. Likewise, injuries to PWs 2 to 4 were also proved by PW 12, Dr. Chandrasekhara Prasad. After completion of investigation, all the accused were charged for offences punishable under Sections 143, 147, 148, 324, 302 read with Section 149 of Indian Penal Code, 1860. The trial Court indicated that the root cause of the quarrel was refusal to exchange copper vessel (Kolaga) to Nagraj, winner of the draw, but he was not examined. Likewise, Krishnaiah, son of Oblaiah, who accompanied injured (deceased) Anjaniappa to the hospital, was not brought before the Court. Though it is in evidence that Accused no. 1 Chandrappa was injured and was also taken to the hospital alongwith Anjaninappa, some witnesses had denied the fact as to injuries sustained by the Accused no. In our view, the submission of the learned counsel for the appellants is well founded that it is not material whether Accused no. 1 had or had not filed a complaint or he was or was not examined by a doctor, but the fact that even though it was the case of prosecution that Accused no. 1 was injured during the course of incident, prosecution witnesses tried to suppress that fact which would throw doubt as to the correctness of the case or the manner in which the incident had happened. The trial Court had also stated that it was unnatural that the prosecution witnesses and deceased Anjaninappa could have gone to Hanumanthapura Bypass at about 30 p.m. when a shorter route was available for going to their destination. The trial Court observed that there was inconsistency in prosecution evidence as to availability of electric light at the time of incident. The Court also noted that the knife produced before the Court as mudamal article was not the same which was used by Accused no. 8 for inflicting injury on the deceased.

Their neighbour farmers, namely, Ramprasad (PW8), Ramsingh (PW9) and Raghunath (PW10) were also guarding over their respective crops and were in the huts constructed in their fields. According to the prosecution, at about 3-4 a.m. early in the morning, cattle of village Nehgawan started grazing the Jowar crop of the deceased. Deceased Balkishan and Sarvan Lal (PW2) surrounded the cattle and started taking them to cattle pond. At that time, all accused persons who were residents of village Nehgawan appeared on the spot. They were armed with lethal weapons, like farsa, ballam, luhangi, lathi, etc. They attacked Balkishan and Sarvan 3 Lal and caused injuries to them. On the shouts of injured Balkishan and Servanlal, Ram Singh, Raghu Nath, Ram Prasad and Ram Niwas reached there and saved Balkishan and Sarvan Lal. The accused did not allow the cattle to be taken to cattle pond and took away with them. While leaving the place, they threatened deceased Balkishan and Sarvan Lal of their lives. 3. Immediately after the incident, deceased Balkishan and Sarvan Lal went to thana and lodged First Information Report (FIR) at Police Station Rannod. The incident was narrated by deceased Balkishan and Case no. Both the injured were then taken to Primary Health Centre, Rannod for medical examination. Dr. Suresh Majeji (PW5) examined Balksihan. He also examined Sarvan Lal. Since the condition of Balkishan was critical, he was taken to District Hospital, 4 Shivpuri. On the way, however, Balkishan died. Postmortem of Balkishan was performed by Dr. G.D. Agrawal (PW 1) on the next day i.e. on October 21, Usual investigation was carried out, accused were arrested, weapons were recovered at their instance and charge was framed against the accused. As far as the contradictions in the deposition of eye witnesses and medical 9 evidence is concerned, in our opinion, the High Court was not right in coming to the conclusion that medical evidence did not support the version of eye-witnesses. It is clearly established from the evidence of injured eye- witness, PW2-Sarvan Lal and PWs 4 and 8 Ram Niwas and Ram Prasad that the prosecution witnesses were in their fields protecting the crop of Jowar in the early morning of October 20, 1989 and the cattle entered the fields. Deceased Balkishan and injured PW2-Sarvan Lal wanted to take them to cattle pond. The said act enraged the accused and they attacked Balkishan and Sarvan Lal which resulted in the death of Balkishan and caused serious injuries to PW2-Sarvan Lal. There was no reason to disbelieve the evidence of prosecution witnesses. PW2-Sarvan Lal was injured during the same incident. Injuries sustained by deceased Balkishan and injured Sarvan Lal-PW2 have been clearly established. The main reason weighed with the High Court was that PW1-Dr. G.D. Agrawal (PW 1) had found seven injuries on the body of the deceased and he had opined that the injuries were caused by hard and blunt substance. PW1-Dr. G.D. Agrawal did not find any incise wound on the head of the deceased. PW5-Dr. Suresh Majeji who had examined the deceased immediately after the incident and advised him to be taken to the District Hospital had stated that there were two incise injuries, one on the middle of the head and the other on the medial aspect of lower 1/3\" of the right leg. Dr. Suresh Majeji (PW5), in his sworn testimony stated that he applied stitches on the wounds of the deceased. Since his condition was serious, he was advised to go to District Hospital but before the deceased reached there, he died. In fact, when a question was put to PW1-Dr. G.D. Agrawal in the cross- examination on behalf of the accused regarding injuries sustained by deceased Balkishan, the latter replied that he did not find incise wound either on the forehead or at the right thigh. He, however, stated; \"After dressing, it is difficult to tell about the nature of injuries\". As far as injuries to the deceased Balkishan are concerned, he had the following injuries; (1) Incised wound 1' x 1/2\" x 1/4\" on the middle of the head. Margin clean cut well defined. (2) No injury seen on the left lower limb. (3) Incised wound d1\"x1/4\"4x1\" deep on the medial aspect of lower 1/3\" of the right leg. Margin clean cut bleeding present, whole lower left leg below knee joint to be left ankle joint. (4) Multiple contusions 4\"x2 and 5\"x2 were present on the back. Bluish red colour. 17. It has also come in evidence that the incident took place `all of a sudden'. When the accused saw that deceased Balkishan and Sarvan Lal were taking cattle to cattle pond, they wanted both of them not to do so and with a view to prevent them from taking cattle to cattle pond, the accused attacked them.", "statute": ["s1"]}, "2015.INSC.709.txt": {"doc_url": "http://www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/2015/709.html", "explanation": {"After completion of pooja while Drums, Shankh and Bells were being played and blown, at about 5.50 am, a group of persons came there holding sticks, axes, swords and stones.": ["s1"], "The mob started assaulting Tanaji, who received injury by a sword.": ["s3", "s1"], "His brothers and family members who tried to intervene were also assaulted.": ["s1"], "His brothers, other relations, sister and wife Sarojini were all the while pleading that he be spared but the mob was relentlessly after Tanaji.": ["s3", "s1"], "The brothers who intervened were also assaulted.": ["s1"], "The members of the mob removed the tiles of the roof and managed to catch Tanaji who was then taken to the field in front of the house of Hemla Tukaram Rathod and assaulted with sword,axes and sattur.": ["s3", "s1"], "The members of the mob then entered the house of Tanaji,carried away all the documents from his house and set them on fire.": ["s1"], "However, Tanaji was found to be dead.": ["s3"]}, "fact": " ##  STATE OF MAHARASHTRA v.

village Loni and A-4 and A-5 are residents of village Shilvani. A-1 is the wife of A-2 and A-3 is their son. A-5 is daughter of A-1 and A-2 and A-4 is the husband of A- Gunwant Nivrati Dhumale was the brother of complainant Tanaji Nivrati Dhumale. Gunwant Nivrati Dhumale had been living with his brothers, namely, Tanaji (PW-1); Shivaji; his parents; his wife Mathurabai (PW-4), and two daughters and one son. The prosecution alleged that Gunwant had illicit relations with A-1 since last so many years and this fact was known to all the village people. Gunwant occasionally used to reside in the house of A-1, A-2 and A- A-1 requested Gunwant to stop visiting her house because her daughter (A-5) has now been married to Venkar (A-4) and her son (A-3) has also become major, but Gunwant continued to visit the house of A- 4. On the day of the incident, i.e. on 1993, Gunwant left his house in the morning and did not return till late evening. Mathurabai (PW-4), wife of Gunwant, informed her parents-in-law about this fact. They asked PW-1 to make search for Gunwant. PW-1 made inquiry about his brother's whereabouts from Namdev (PW-5) at about 00 p.m. , who at the relevant time was working as a servant in Flour Mill near the bus stand. PW-5 informed PW-1 that he saw A-1, A-2 and A-3 along with A-5 hurriedly going towards the Bus Stand. Thereafter, PW-1 and some other village people went to the house of A- They found the doors of the house lying open and the house was empty. They noticed the dead body of Gunwant lying just in the compound of the house of A-1, A-2 and A- On visual examination of the dead body of Gunwant, PW-1 and other village people noticed head injury and many other injuries on various parts of his body. On 1993, PW-1 lodged the report on the basis of which first information report (Ext.38) was registered by the Police Head Constable, Ganesh (PW-10) naming A-1, A-2, A-3, A-4 and A-5, as culprits for the murder of Gunwant. 5. The Head Constable (PW-10), on the next day of occurrence, went to the spot of the incident and collected stones, axe and soil, etc. from the spot vide Spot Panchnama (Ext.44). He also prepared inquest report of dead body of Gunwant (Ext.43). The dead body of Gunwant was sent for post mortem examination to Primary Health Centre, Hanegaon. PW-2, Dr. Hanumant, conducted autopsy on the dead body of Gunwant. He noticed about 13 injuries on his dead body. All the injuries were ante-mortem. The post mortem report placed on record is marked as Ext. In the opinion of the Doctor, the death of Gunwant occurred because of shock due to cardio respiratory failure, caused by injury to brain and brain hemorrhage. PW-10 seized the blood-stained clothes of the deceased. He handed over further investigation to PSI Mirza Rahematulla Baig (PW-11). PW-11 recorded supplementary statements of PW-1 and other witnesses. He made search of the accused persons in and around village Loni, but they could not be located. On 1993, he arrested A-1, A-2 and A-3 near village Degloor. On 1993, he arrested A-4 and A-5 at Markhei. On 1993, he recorded statements of Hariba (PW-6) and Eknath (PW-7). On 1993, A-1, while in police custody, made statement (Ext.63) on the basis of which she recovered her clothes and clothes of her husband and son from her house, which were taken into possession vide Panchnama (Ext.64). On 1993, five prosecution witnesses were produced before Shri Nivrati (PW-13), the Special Judicial Magistrate, for recording their statements under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (for short 'Cr. P.C. ). The clothes of A-1, A-2 and A-3 and the deceased and other articles found on the spot were sent to the Chemical Analyser. The report of the Chemical Analyser (Ext.70) reveals that ethyl alcohol was detected in the viscera contents of the deceased. The Chemical Analyser's report (Ext.72) reveals that human blood was detected on the clothes worn by the deceased and the clothes worn by A-1, A-2 and A- 6. After completion of the investigation and after receipt of the post mortem report and reports of the Chemical Analyser, charge sheet was filed against A-1, A-2, A-3, A-4 and A-5 for the commission of the crime. The prosecution relied upon the following circumstances: (i) Illicit relations of the deceased Gunwant with Smt. Shantabai (A-1) since last 10 to 15 years; (ii) The dead body of Gunwant was found in the courtyard of the house of A-1, A-2 and A-3 at village Loni; (iii) A-1, A-2 and A-3 were not found present at their house on 1993, the day of occurrence, when PW-1 along with other villagers went to their house in search of Gunwant; (iv) PW-5, Namdev, had seen A-1, A-2, A-3, A-4 and A-5 going towards the Bus Stand on the evening of 1993; (v) Medical evidence; (vi) Recovery of the clothes of A-1, A-2 and A-3 from their house; and (vii) The clothes of A-1, A-2 and A-3 recovered by the Police at the instance of A-1 from their house, were found blood-stained of human blood of Group 'O' in the Chemical Analyser's report (Ext.71). Before adverting to the arguments advanced by the learned counsel, we shall at the threshold point out that in the present case there is no direct evidence to connect A-1, A-2 and A-3 with the commission of the offence and the prosecution rests its case solely on circumstantial evidence. So far as the first circumstance is concerned, the prosecution has adduced the evidence of PW-1, brother and PW-4, wife respectively of the deceased. Both these witnesses have made a bald and sweeping statement that A-1 had illicit relations with the deceased for the last about 10 to 15 years before the day of the incident. PW-5, a co-villager of the deceased, stated that he heard some village people talking about the illicit relations of the deceased with A- The evidence of PW-5 is hearsay version and it cannot be accepted without corroboration from the person who told this fact to PW- PW-1, brother, and PW-4, wife of the deceased, have categorically stated that the deceased was maternal uncle of A-1 and he occasionally used to visit the house of A-1, A-2 and A- It has come in the evidence of PW-1 that the deceased was living in his house with his wife (PW-4) along with one son aged about 20 to 22 years and two daughters, out of whom one is aged about 30 years and the second is about 14 to 15 years respectively. It is his evidence that A-5 (acquitted accused), daughter of A-1 and A-2, was married to A-4 (acquitted accused) about 5 to 7 years prior to the day of the incident. A-3 is also a major son of A-1 and A- The testimony of these witnesses in regard to the illicit relations of A-1 with the deceased for the last many years is wholly unbelievable and unconvincing in view of the fact that A-1 has been living with her husband (A-2), her major son (A-3) and daughter (A-5) (acquitted) in the same village in which PW-1, brother of the deceased, his parents and PW-4 (wife) were residing along with her son and two daughters. Had there been any such illicit relations, the entire village people would have come to know about this fact and the parents of the deceased would have never tolerated him to do so, more so when it has come in the evidence of these witnesses that the deceased was maternal uncle of A- The prosecution has not examined the parents of the deceased and some other village people in support of this circumstance. The prosecution has also not led any evidence to establish that on the day of occurrence the deceased had visited the house of A-1, A-2 and A- This circumstance cannot be said to be of a conclusive nature and tendency to prove that A-1, A-2 and A-3 had murdered Gunwant on the day of occurrence because he allegedly had illicit relations with A-1 for the past over many years. In view of this fact, it is not possible to place implicit reliance upon the evidence of PW-1 and PW-4, the selective and interrogated witnesses. PW-5, PW-6 and PW-7 are residents of the same village to which A-1, A-2 and A-3 and the deceased do belong, but they have not uttered a word in regard to factum of the illicit relations of the deceased with A- 1. PW-4 has deposed that the dead body of her husband was lying in the 'Wada', whereas PW-1, PW-4, PW-5, PW-6, PW-7 and PW-8 stated that the dead body was placed in the open place outside the house of the appellants. Circumstance no. II 18. In support of the second circumstance, the prosecution has brought on record the evidence of PW-3, who is one of the Panchas of Spot Panchnama and Inquest Panchnama. The other witnesses, who saw the dead body of the deceased in the courtyard, are PW-1, PW-4, PW-5, PW-6, PW-7 and PW- The evidence of all these witnesses would suggest that when they went on the spot of incident, the doors of the house of A-1, A-2 and A-3 were found left open. It has come in the evidence of PW-1 that there is a public way on the southern side of the house of A-1, A-2 and A-3 and there is one Wada by the northern side of their house and the owner of the said Wada is Ram Sawakar. In cross-examination, he stated that there is one open space in between the house of the appellants and Wada of Ram Sawakar and the dead body of his brother- Gunwant was lying in open space near the Wada. He also stated that there are some Kirana Shops in the eastern side of the open space of the house of A-1, A-2 and A- This being the position, it is not safe to connect A-1, A-2 and A-3 with the commission of the death of Gunwant merely because the dead body of the deceased was found in an open space in front of their house, which is a public road. In support of the third and fourth circumstances, the prosecution has led the evidence of PW-1 and Namdev (PW-5). It is the version of PW-1 that in the evening on 1993, he along with Police Patil and other villagers went in search of his brother-Gunwant in the village and they found the dead body of Gunwant in front of the house of A-1, A-2 and A-3 in an open place with multiple injuries on his body. They found that A-1, A-2 and A-3 were not present in their house and the doors of their house were left open. PW-5, who at the relevant time was serving at the flour mill situated near the Bus Stand, stated that at about 00 p.m. on the day of incident when he came out of the flour mill and was going to toilet, he saw A-1, A-2, A-3 and A-5 going hurriedly towards the Bus Stand. On the basis of this evidence, the accused persons are suspected to be the authors of the crime who, according to the prosecution version, had left their house after committing the murder of Gunwant. We are afraid to hold A-1, A-2 and A-3 guilty of the murder of Gunwant and throwing his dead body in front of their house in the open place and then hurriedly left their house open in order to escape their arrest and final punishment in relation to the commission of heinous offence of murder. PW-5 in his deposition stated that PW-1, brother of the deceased, came to him on the day of occurrence at about 00 p.m. and enquired from him about the whereabouts of his brother-Gunwant to which he replied that he did not see Gunwant on the day of occurrence. This witness also stated that after some time PW-1 again came to the flour mill and enquired second time from him whether he had seen Gunwant to which he replied that he did not meet Gunwant on that day, but he disclosed to PW-1 that he had seen A-1, A-2, A-3 and A-5 going hurriedly towards the nearby bus stand. On examination of the evidence of this witness, we have noticed that he has named A-5, who was also accompanying A-1, A-2 and A-3 when they were going to the bus stand on the day of occurrence. The testimony of this witness appears to be wholly inconsistent and unbelievable to hold that he, in fact, had seen the appellants and A-5 going to the bus stand in the evening of If he had seen the appellants along with A-5 going to bus stand, he could have disclosed this fact to PW-1 at the earliest occasion at about 00 p.m. when he, for the first time, was asked by PW-1 in regard to the whereabouts of his brother-Gunwant. It has come on record that there were many other employees present in the Mill when PW-1 met PW-5 on both occasions in the evening of If the version of this witness has been discarded and disbelieved by the Trial Court in regard to A-5 having accompanied the appellants when they were stated to be going to bus stand in the evening, the same set of reasoning will apply to A-1, A-2 and A-3 and, therefore, the testimony of this witness is not free from doubt and he does not appear to be a truthful witness to connect A-1, A-2 and A- 3 with the commission of the crime. In support of the fifth circumstance, the prosecution has examined Dr. Hanumant, who performed post mortem on the dead body of the deceased-Gunwant on Doctor noticed as many as 13 injuries on the body of the deceased as described in the post mortem report (Ext. 41). According to the opinion of the Doctor, the cause of death was because of shock due to cardio respiratory failure caused by injury to brain and brain hemorrhage. The Chemical Analyser's report would reveal that ethyl alcohol was found in the viscera contents of the deceased. We may point out that the Investigating Officer has not cared to collect the finger prints appeared on the stones and axe, the alleged weapons of offence, at the time of seizure of the articles nor he had taken the finger prints of the appellants for comparison with the finger prints, if any, detected on the alleged weapons of offence. The articles collected by the Investigating Officer from the spot were found lying in the open place which was accessible to all and sundry. The prosecution has not led any evidence to prove that axe, which was the alleged weapon of offence, found on spot in the open place belonged to A-1, A-2 and A- Thus, the prosecution has not established beyond reasonable doubt that A-1, A-2 and A-3 had used the recovered weapons of offence in the commission of the crime. In support of the sixth and seventh circumstances, the prosecution has relied upon the evidence of PW-9, Ram Woglaji, a panch witness of seizure panchanama of the clothes. In his presence the Police recorded the statement of A-1 in Police Station on 1993 disclosing the concealment of the clothes of the accused persons in her house. It is the evidence of this witness that A-1, besides handing over one saree and blouse, she also produced one dhoti and one baniyan of A-2 (her husband), one saree and one blouse of her daughter (A-5), one lungi and one sando baniyan of A-3 (son) and one pant and one bushirt of A-4 (her son-in- law). The evidence of this witness has to be discarded and straightaway rejected from consideration simply on the ground that he is not an independent witness, but a stock witness of the Police. In his cross-examination, he admitted that there are about 2 to 4 criminal cases pending against him. He stated that there was no door to the Madi from where the clothes were recovered at the instance of A- The Trial Court has disbelieved the evidence of this witness to the extent of the recovery of the clothes of A-4 and A-5 (acquitted) from the open Madi. The Chemical Analyser's report (Ext.72) reveals that human blood of Group 'B' was detected on the clothes, which were seized by the Police, allegedly belonging to the appellants. The blood group on those clothes did not tally with the blood of Group 'O', which was found on the clothes of the deceased and on the sample of soil, axe, stones, handles. etc which were taken from the spot by the Investigating Officer. The Investigating Officer has categorically stated that when he along with A-1 and panch witnesses had gone in search of the clothes of the appellants, the lock to the door of the house of the appellants was kept with Police Patil which was opened by them later on. In this view of the matter, the prosecution has not proved that the clothes, which were allegedly seized by the Police at the instance of A-1 and lying in the open place, were stained with blood group 'O' of the deceased found on deceased's clothes and on the articles which were seized by the Investigating Officer from the place of occurrence.", "statute": ["s1"]}, "2009.INSC.1350.txt": {"doc_url": "http://www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/2009/1350.html", "explanation": {"PW-1 Vishwanathan, in his deposition, stated in details as to how all the accused persons came to the grocery shop of the deceased and vandalized the same.": ["s1"], "It is also not in dispute that the deceased at the earliest possible opportunity was taken to the Omalur Government Hospital and on being referred to the Government Hospital, Salem was taken there.": ["s1"], "\" PW-11 also recorded the manner in which the incident had taken place as also the weapons of attack.": ["s1"], "Indisputably, the casuarina sticks were recovered on the basis of the statements of the appellants.": ["s1"], "The injuries suffered by the deceased have been proved.": ["s1"], "The medical evidences in no uncertain terms corroborate the depositions of the eye-witnesses.": ["s1"], "The injuries on the person of the deceased were found to have been inflicted by the appellants and the appellants alone.": ["s1"], "The fact that the shop of the deceased was located near the residential colony of the members of the Adi Dravida Community is not in dispute.": ["s1"], "It is also not in dispute that they held a function on the Republic Day.": ["s1"], "The fact that electrical 11 connection was taken from the shop premises of the deceased wherefor a case for theft of electrical energy was recorded has been established.": ["s1"], "The eye-witnesses account clearly proved the motive on the part of the accused to commit the said offence.": ["s1"], "The deceased being a member of the Naidu Community was reprimanded by his community member as he had tried to do something for the members of the other community.": ["s1"], "Appellants along with others were members of an unlawful assembly.": ["s1"], "They came to the shop of the deceased with deadly weapons.": ["s1"], "It was witnessed, apart from PWs 1 and 2 also, by PW-3 who was owner of a tailoring shop which was situated by the side of the shop of the deceased.": ["s1"], "PW-3 was a witness to both part of the occurrence, viz.": ["s1"], ", the action on the part of the accused to come to the shop of the deceased and threatening him in the night of 1997 and their visit on the following morning and assaulting the deceased ultimately resulting in his death.": ["s1"], "The occurrence might have taken place on Sunday but there is nothing to show that the shops were closed.": ["s1"], "The shop being open, we find no reason to disbelieve the deposition of PW-1 to state in details in regard to the manner in which the occurrence had taken place.": ["s1"], "But, the courts cannot also ignore the ground realities that the relatives of the deceased would give priority to the treatment of a severely injured person.": ["s1"], "All attempts would first be made to save his life.": ["s1"], "The action on the part of the prosecution witnesses, in our considered opinion, in giving priority to the treatment to the injured was wholly justifiable.": ["s1"], "The fact that he had to be brought to the Nursing Home by PWs is again a pointer to the fact that they were busy in not only making arrangements for proper medical treatment of the deceased but also intimating the son of the deceased (PW-4) and bringing him to the hospital at the earliest possible opportunity.": ["s1"], "PW-2's presence, therefore, at the place of occurrence, cannot be doubted or disputed.": ["s1"], "Prosecution witnesses in their depositions clearly brought out the motive on the part of the accused to commit the crime.": ["s1"], "Appellants had formed an unlawful assembly.": ["s1"], "They came to the place of occurrence with deadly weapons.": ["s1"], "The overt acts attributed to them resulted in causing serious injuries on the head of the deceased.": ["s1"], "They not only were grievous in nature, the skull of the deceased was also found fractured.": ["s1"], "The intensity of the assault on the person of the deceased by the appellants, therefore, can be well imagined.": ["s1"], "When three injuries have been caused on vital parts of the body, we have no doubt in our mind that the appellants knew that the said injuries were likely to cause death or cause such bodily injury which may result in death.": ["s1"]}, "fact": " Bammiyampatti is a small village situated in the District of Salem in the State of Tamil Nadu.

Rangasamy, deceased was having a grocery shop. He despite being belonging to the Naidu community, permitted the members of the other community to take electricity from his shop. Having come to learn of the same, the accused persons, originally eight in number, got infuriated.

A lacerated wound on the left side of the crown of the head. 3. Contusion over the right eye brow. 4. Further, on the crown of the head, a lacerated wound on the right side. 5. Contusion on the back side of the head. \" PW-11 also recorded the manner in which the incident had taken place as also the weapons of attack. Indisputably, the casuarina sticks were recovered on the basis of the statements of the appellants. PWs 1 and 2 may be closely related to the deceased but the same, in our opinion, by itself, would not be a ground for rejecting their testimonies outright. PW-3 was not related to the deceased. The injuries suffered by the deceased have been proved. The medical evidences in no uncertain terms corroborate the depositions of the eye-witnesses. The injuries on the person of the deceased were found to have been inflicted by the appellants and the appellants alone. The fact that the shop of the deceased was located near the residential colony of the members of the Adi Dravida Community is not in dispute. It is also not in dispute that they held a function on the Republic Day. The fact that electrical 11 connection was taken from the shop premises of the deceased wherefor a case for theft of electrical energy was recorded has been established. The eye-witnesses account clearly proved the motive on the part of the accused to commit the said offence. The deceased being a member of the Naidu Community was reprimanded by his community member as he had tried to do something for the members of the other community. Appellants along with others were members of an unlawful assembly. They came to the shop of the deceased with deadly weapons. It was witnessed, apart from PWs 1 and 2 also, by PW-3 who was owner of a tailoring shop which was situated by the side of the shop of the deceased. PW-3 was a witness to both part of the occurrence, viz. , the action on the part of the accused to come to the shop of the deceased and threatening him in the night of 1997 and their visit on the following morning and assaulting the deceased ultimately resulting in his death. The occurrence might have taken place on Sunday but there is nothing to show that the shops were closed. The occurrence has 12 taken place inside a shop and not inside a residential house. The shop being open, we find no reason to disbelieve the deposition of PW-1 to state in details in regard to the manner in which the occurrence had taken place. Presence of PWs 2 and 3 at the place of occurrence has also been found to be acceptable by the courts below. Some delay might have been caused in lodging of the First Information Report, but, the same has sufficiently been explained. It is true that PW-7 in his evidence stated that he had sent the information to the police station but he also admitted that the same was not recorded in the accident register. PW-7 was examined on , i.e. , after a period of more than six years from the date of the incident. At the time of his deposition, he was working in the ESI Hospital, Salem as Medical Officer. The Inspector of Police PW-13 in his evidence categorically stated that he received the telephonic message at about 6 O'Clock in the evening from the Nursing Home and he reached there at about 7 O'Clock. We do not find any reason to disbelieve the said evidence brought on record by the prosecution. 13 19. No doubt lodging of a First Information Report at the earliest possible opportunity is desirable. But, the courts cannot also ignore the ground realities that the relatives of the deceased would give priority to the treatment of a severely injured person. All attempts would first be made to save his life. The action on the part of the prosecution witnesses, in our considered opinion, in giving priority to the treatment to the injured was wholly justifiable. PW-4 Sekaran, son of the deceased in his deposition, who has not been cross-examined, categorically stated that he had been working in a company known as Power Held Corporation of India at K.R. Thoppur. He was informed about the incident by his maternal aunt Chandra (PW-2) when she came in a car and took him to the Shanmugha Nursing Home where the deceased was admitted in its Intensive Care Unit. The fact that he had to be brought to the Nursing Home by PWs is again a pointer to the fact that they were busy in not only making arrangements for proper medical treatment of the deceased but also intimating the son of the deceased (PW-4) and bringing him to the hospital at the earliest possible opportunity. We, therefore, are of the opinion that the delay in lodging the First Information Report has sufficiently been explained. PW-3, as noticed hereinbefore, is owner of a tailoring shop 14 which is situated by the side of the shop belonging to the deceased. The place of occurrence is a small village. PW-2's presence, therefore, at the place of occurrence, cannot be doubted or disputed. Prosecution witnesses in their depositions clearly brought out the motive on the part of the accused to commit the crime. Appellants had formed an unlawful assembly. They came to the place of occurrence with deadly weapons. The overt acts attributed to them resulted in causing serious injuries on the head of the deceased. They not only were grievous in nature, the skull of the deceased was also found fractured. The intensity of the assault on the person of the deceased by the appellants, therefore, can be well imagined. When three injuries have been caused on vital parts of the body, we have no doubt in our mind that the appellants knew that the said injuries were likely to cause death or cause such bodily injury which may result in death.", "statute": ["s1"]}, "2008.INSC.723.txt": {"doc_url": "http://www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/2008/723.html", "explanation": {", they saw all the accused as well as Bhoomesha and Manja assaulting Thimmappa with sickles and choppers.": ["s1"], "The accused Siddeshappa and Hanumanthappa also abused and assaulted the two women.": ["s1"], "It was also noticed that the accused while running away had left behind a sickle and a club near the dead body.": ["s1"]}, "fact": " The facts leading to the filing of this appeal by way of special leave are as under: 2. PW-1 Bhagyavathi, wife of Thimmappa deceased of village Arebilachi, is the complainant in the case. Thimmappa was the son of Navilapa. Navilapa had, in addition, five other sons Devendrappa, Manjappa, Chandrappa, Nagarajappa and Gadigeshappa and two daughters including Ratnamma PW- Navilapa had about 12 acres of ancestral land and he had divided the said land equally between himself and his sons and all were in possession of their respective shares thereafter. Thimmappa, Devendrappa and Manjappa were residing separately whereas the other two, Chandrappa and Gadigeshappa, were residing in their old family home whereas Nagarajappa was residing with his father Navilapa and his sister Ratnamma. Thimmappa, however, acquired about 10 acres of land on his own but his brothers Chandrappa and Gadigeshappa were demanding a share out of this land as well and on account of this development, the relationship between the brothers had become strained. Chandrappa and Gadigeshappa also filed a suit seeking a share in the 10 acres acquired by Thimmappa with the result that the relation between the brothers was further strained. At about 4 p.m. on 1993, Thimmappa told his wife Bhagyavathi that he had learnt that Chandrappa and Gadigeshappa had gone to the field to pluck coconuts and that he was going to prevent them from doing so. Thimmappa and his brother Devendrappa PW3 then left for the fields on a scooter. A few minutes later Rathnamma PW2, sister-in-law of Bhagyavathi PW-1 came to her house and informed her that she had seen Chandrappa and Gadigeshappa accompanied by their brother-in-law Hanumanthappa, Shiva and Siddeshappa along with Bhoomesha and Manja proceeding towards the field armed with Choppers and sickles and she apprehended some danger. Bhagyavathi and Rathnamma then left for the field and as they reached the outer fencing at about 30 p.m. , they saw all the accused as well as Bhoomesha and Manja assaulting Thimmappa with sickles and choppers. PW3 Devendrappa went to the rescue of his brother but he too was assaulted and having sustained an injury he ran away towards the village. PWs1 and 2 thereafter entered the garden and saw that Thimmappa was lying grievously injured near the Samadhi adjoining the land. The accused Siddeshappa and Hanumanthappa also abused and assaulted the two women. PW4 Prashanth Kumar, who was attracted to the place, rushed in with some water which he attempted to put into Thimmappa's mouth but he succumbed to his injuries at the spot. PW3 Devendrappa was also taken to the Bhadravathi hospital by PW11 Rudrappa whereas PWs.1,2 and 4 stood near the dead body. It was also noticed that the accused while running away had left behind a sickle and a club near the dead body.

They had two other brothers and five sisters. One of the sister is Daya Wati (PW-5), aged about 17 years at the time of the incident. Ram Kumar (A-1) and Ram Nath (A-5) are the real brothers, while Ramesh (A-2) is the son of their cousin. Excepting Mani Ram (A-3), all the accused persons were from a single family. There was some enmity between the family of the accused and the family of the deceased. There were number of murders. Ram Raj, who was one of the brothers of Prithvi Raj and Raj Kumar (deceased) was murdered on In that murder case, Prithvi Raj (PW-1) had named 7 assailants, out of whom one was Ram Naresh (A-6). In that case, deceased Raj Kumar was a witnesections In the murder case of Ram Raj, the prosecution evidence was to begin from 1978, i.e. , about 12 days after the incident, which took place on In short, there is a strong motive of enmity in between the accused party and the complainant party. It so happened that on the fateful day, i.e. , 1978, Raj Kumar (deceased) went to his tubewell, which is at about 100-125 paces from his house and after watering the field, he came back home at about 30 p.m. , 4 as there was no electric current available. He again started for his tubewell and his sister Daya Wati (PW-5) and his mother and wife of Prithvi Raj, i.e. , his sister-in-law also followed him. When Prithvi Raj came out of his house, Prahlad (PW-4) met him. Prahlad had come to the village to purchase the seeds. Two other persons also met him there and they also started towards the tubewell. The moment, they reached near the Neem tree situated at a distance of 15 paces from the house of the deceased, all the accused accosted him, surrounded him and dragged him by pulling near the well upto a distance of 10-15 paces. Ram Naresh (A-6) then exhorted that Raj Kumar (deceased) should be murdered in the same manner in which his brother Ram Raj was murdered, so that Raj Kumar may not appear as a witnesections Thereupon, Mani Ram (A-3) fired a shot from his country made pistol, which was followed by a second shot of fire from the country made pistol of Swami Nath (A-4). Ramesh (A-2) put a cartridge into a country made pistol and gave it to Ram Kumar (A-1), who also fired a shot at Raj Kumar, due to which Raj Kumar died on the spot. All the accused persons then ran away. Because of the injuries, blood started coming out and the clothes of Raj Kumar were soaked. They included, in all, 7 Exhibits. Within about 15 minutes, at about 15 p.m. , Prithvi Raj (PW-1) came back on his cycle from Village Dewara Kala, where he had gone for doing his duty as Panchayat Sewak. He found the dead body of Raj Kumar. He talked to his wife and mother and his sister 5 Daya Wati (PW-5). Other witnesses, namely, Prahlad (PW-4) and Rajendra Singh and Surendra (both not examined by the prosecution) were also present there. Dr. Tripathi (PW- 2), who had performed the autopsy, found five injuries on the body of Raj Kumar (deceased), three being the entry wounds and two being the exit wounds. He also confirmed that all the three injuries were sufficient, in ordinary course of nature, to cause death. The High Court came to the conclusion that the evidence of Prahlad (PW-4) and Daya Wati (PW-5) were absolutely trustworthy and stood the acid test of cross-examination. The High Court further held that there was enough support in corroborating evidence, inasmuch as in the FIR itself, names of all the accused persons alongwith the part played by each of them was reflected. It was also held by the High Court that there was no possibility of ante-dating the FIR. The factum of this murder was mentioned in the other FIR, wherein it was complained that the complainants in this case have caused the murder of 7 one of the persons of the accused party and since that FIR was already recorded by 45 p.m. , there was no question of ante-dating the present FIR. The High Court also held that the medical evidence was enough to prove the guilt. Seeing the evidence, we are convinced that the eye- witnesses are truthful and were rightly believed by the High Court. Shri Jaspal Singh criticized the evidence of these two witnesses, suggesting that the enmity between the parties should have been held on the backdrop before accepting the evidence of these two witnesses. He is quite right, as the law on the subject is that evidence of the interested witness should be appreciated, keeping that enmity in mind. Merely because Prahlad (PW-4) was not from the same village, it cannot be said that he had no business in the village. It has come in the evidence clearly that the distance between the village of Prahlad (PW-4) and the village where the incident took place is hardly about 5 km. Therefore, his coming to the village for purchasing the seeds cannot be viewed with a suspicion. It is also not necessary that Prahlad (PW-4) should have straightaway gone only to the shop of the seeds and purchased the seeds. After all, Prahlad (PW-4) knew the deceased Raj Kumar and in fact, Prahlad (PW-4) was cross-examined in that direction. If Prahlad (PW-4) already knew deceased Raj Kumar and if he went just to visit him, we do not think, this by itself, would be reason to disbelieve his testimony. In villages, the people do normally go to each 9 other's house. Again the criticism that Prahlad (PW-4) had no business to go and accompany Raj Kumar to his field, is also of no consequence, as Prahlad (PW-4) might have walked alongwith Raj Kumar hardly for 20-25 paces. In fact, the distance between the house of Raj Kumar and his tubewell is hardly about 100-125 paces, which has come in the evidence. Therefore, even if Prahlad (PW-4) walked alongwith deceased, that by itself, does not make his version suspicious in any manner. We have seen the original version (in Hindi), which convinces us that even Daya Wati (PW-5) has said that the deceased was actually pulled and pushed to the place, where he was actually fired upon. Even otherwise, ordinarily the deceased would not have gone alnogwith his enemy just by walking and his being dragged or being pulled would be only a natural thing, which the witnesses supported. There is one mistake on the question of Ramesh (A-2) loading the pistol with cartridges and giving it to the other accused. That was obviously a mistake, which has been explained by the Trial Court as in the cross- examination of Daya Wati (PW-5), it has very specifically come that it was Ram Kumar (A-1) who fired. Therefore, the confusion caused was also 10 cleared. It was admitted by both the eye-witnesses that there were about 10-12 persons, who were watching the incident. The enmity between the two parties was known, there was also murders and counter murders. Under such circumstances, if the witnesses do not become available, it is not the fault of the investigating agency. This is apart from the fact that the Investigating Officer was not asked about the aspect of witnesses being available.", "statute": ["s1"]}, "2016.INSC.416.txt": {"doc_url": "http://www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/2016/416.html", "explanation": {"According to the prosecution case, two appellants who are brothers alongwith female family members, Guddi Devi, Seema and Gulab Devi formed an unlawful assembly in their village on 2008 at 00 a.m.": ["s1"], "Armed with lethal weapons they went near the Bada of Jagram and caused injuries to Sajana Devi with blunt weapon, simple injury to Jagram and his wife Malli Devi with blunt as well as incised weapon and also caused simple as well as grievous injuries to Kailash Chand with blunt and incised weapon.": ["s1"], "They examined Dr. Suresh Chand Meena and Bhagwan Sahai Meena as PW1 and PW2 and also proved documentary evidence-exhibits D1 to D The defence witnesses were examined to support the contention that the members of the prosecution party had beaten one Kanchan, father of the appellants and as a result he subsequently died.": ["s1"], "The High Court has also noted that both the sides had taken a plea that the land in question where the occurrence had taken place is in their possession.": ["s1"], "One of the injured Malli Devi-PW6 also deposed, as noted by the High Court, that the parties were having dispute with the accused over land.": ["s1"], "The appellants can legitimately claim right to use force once they saw their parents being assaulted and when actually it has been shown that due to such assault and injury their father subsequently died.": ["s1"], "In the given facts, adverse inference must be drawn against the prosecution for not offering any explanation much less a plausible one.": ["s1"], "Drawing of such adverse inference is given a go-bye in the case of free fight mainly because the occurrence in that case may take place at different spots and in such a manner that a witness may not reasonably be expected to see and therefore explain the injuries sustained by the defence party.": ["s1"]}, "fact": " According to the prosecution case, two appellants who are brothers alongwith female family members, Guddi Devi, Seema and Gulab Devi formed an unlawful assembly in their village on 2008 at 00 a.m. Armed with lethal weapons they went near the Bada of Jagram and caused injuries to Sajana Devi with blunt weapon, simple injury to Jagram and his wife Malli Devi with blunt as well as incised weapon and also caused simple as well as grievous injuries to Kailash Chand with blunt and incised weapon.
