Challenge in this appeal is to the judgment of a learned Single Judge of the Madhya Pradesh High Court upholding the conviction of the appellant for offence punishable under Section 376 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (in short the `IPC'). But the sentence of seven years as was imposed by the trial court i.e. the Court of Session Judge, Rajnandgaon was reduced to five years and fine of Rs.20,000/- was imposed under Section 357(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (in short the `Cr.P.C.'). It was held that in case the fine is not paid within the stipulated time, custodial sentence of seven years as imposed by the trial court shall be maintained. 2. According to prosecution in the morning of 10th June, 1988 the accused had taken the advantage of the helplessness of the victim and committed rape on her. First Information Report was lodged around 11 A.M., and she was sent for medical examination. The accused after his arrest on 12th June, 1988 was sent for medical examination. Certain articles were also sent for chemical examination. After completion of the investigation, charge sheet was filed and the accused pleaded innocence and false implication. The prosecution in order to establish the accusations examined several witnesses including the prosecutrix who was examined PW2 and the Doctor, who examined PW 7. The investigating officer was examined as PW 9. PW 8 was the Sub-inspector posted in the Rajnandgaon police station. Before the trial court the prosecutrix stated the age of the victim to be 14 years. Since the accused was taking the plea of consent, the prosecution rely on clause six of Section 375 I.P.C. to contend that consent was of no consequence as she was below 16 years of age. In any event, there was no evidence of any consent. The trial court found the age of the victim to be around 16 years. But it came to the conclusion that there was no consent as claimed by the accused. Accordingly the conviction was recorded and the sentence of seven years imprisonment was imposed alongwith fine of Rs.100/-. As noted above the High Court in the appeal filed by the appellant maintained the conviction and sentence of five years and enhanced the fine to Rs.20,000/-. It was indicated that in case the fine was paid the same was to be given to the victim and in case it was not paid, the sentence imposed by the trial court was to be maintained.", "statute": ["s4"]}, "2011.INSC.21.txt": {"doc_url": "http://www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/2011/21.html", "explanation": {"He pulled her down and grabbed her breasts and attempted to commit rape on her.": ["s4"]}, "fact": "3. According to the prosecution case, on February 2, 1998, at about 10.00 A.M., the prosecutrix had gone out to the fields for relieving herself. There she was accosted by the appellant. Seeing him take off his pants, the prosecutrix tried to run away but the appellant caught hold of her and pulled her down to the ground. The prosecutrix freed herself by biting on the appellant's hand and ran towards her house. The appellant chased her and again caught hold of her. He pulled her down and grabbed her breasts and attempted to commit rape on her. She resisted him and in their struggle some mustard crops grown in the field were also damaged. On alarm raised by the prosecutrix, her mother and uncle came to the spot and on seeing them, the appellant ran away threatening the prosecutrix that he would kill her in case she went to the police. 5. The Additional Sessions Judge, Narnaul, trying the offence, on a consideration of the evidence adduced before him, found and held that the charge against the appellant was fully proved and by judgment and order dated February 13/15, 1999, passed in Sessions Case No.39 of 6.10.1998, Sessions Trial No.1 of 1.2.1999 convicted and sentenced him, as noted above. Against the judgment and order passed by the trial court, the appellant preferred an appeal (Criminal Appeal No.174-SB of 1999) before the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh. The High Court dismissed the appeal by judgment and order dated October 15, 2009, maintaining the conviction and sentence awarded to the appellant. 7. From the judgment of the High Court coming under appeal, it appears that the plea of the appellant's juvenility was raised at an early stage of the proceedings and the Principal Magistrate, Juvenile Justice Court, Narnaul, by his order dated March 20, 1998 had found that the appellant was a juvenile. Against the order of the Principal Magistrate, the State went in appeal and the learned Sessions Judge, Narnaul, reversed the findings of the Principal Magistrate, Juvenile Justice Court, observing that the date of birth of the appellant as recorded in the Deaths and Births Register maintained by the Registrar was August 14, 1981 and reckoned on that basis, he was not a juvenile on February 2, 1998, the date of the occurrence. As a consequence, the appellant was tried not before a Juvenile Court, but before the Additional Sessions Judge, Narnaul. 10. In the Juvenile Justice Act, 1986, a `juvenile' was defined under section 2(h) to mean a boy who has not attained the age of 16 years or a girl who has not attained the age of 18 years. On the basis of the finding of the Sessions Judge that on the date of occurrence, the appellant was over 16 years of age, he did not come within the definition of `juvenile' under the 1986 Act.", "statute": ["s4"]}, "2005.INSC.650.txt": {"doc_url": "http://www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/2005/650.html", "explanation": {"He then forcibly made Kumari Seema to lie on the bed and after untying the waistband of her salwar started to commit rape on her.

He not only delicts the law but it is a betrayal of trust. The father is the fortress and refuge of his daughter in whom the daughter trusts. Charged of raping his own daughter under his refuge and fortress is worst than the gamekeeper becoming a poacher and treasury guard becoming a robber. The facts of this case as unfolded by the prosecution shocked the judicial conscience. Briefly stated the facts are as follows:- The respondent-accused Asha Ram married to one Smt.Kalawati - PW3. Out of the wedlock they have three daughters and two sons. Accused and PW-3 were having strained relations and living separately. PW-3 was living in some servant quarters in Brock- hurst with one of the daughters and two sons. Accused was living in the accommodation allotted to him in the servant quarters attached to Raj Bhawan with the other two daughters namely Kumari Uma and Kumari Seema (prosecutrix). In the intervening night of 23/24.8.1988 the accused returned home at about 12.30 AM and went to the room where his daughters Uma and Seema were sleeping. He asked Kumari Seema to serve him the dinner. On being asked, the prosecutrix went to the kitchen and brought the food to the room of the accused. The accused is alleged to have bolted the door of his room from inside and after switching off the light asked Kumari Seema to sleep in the same room. He then forcibly made Kumari Seema to lie on the bed and after untying the waistband of her salwar started to commit rape on her. The prosecutrix pleaded with the accused that she is his daughter but he turned a deaf ear and forcibly committed sexual intercourse with her. It is further alleged that when she tried to raise cries, her mouth was gagged by the accused with a piece of cloth. Her sister Uma started knocking at the door. After about half an hour when she came out of the room of her father she found the door of the quarters, where her sister was sleeping, bolted from outside and her sister was not at home. Being frightened she climbed down from sanitary pipe. She met her sister on the ground floor of the building and both returned to their quarter. She narrated the entire occurrence to her sister Uma. On the following morning they went to their mother to inform her about the occurrence. The prosecutrix accompanied by her mother went to the police station and on the basis of her statement lodged a complaint registered vide FIR No.110 of 1988 (Ex.PA) under Section 376 IPC. In the course of investigation a prima facie case was established. A charge was laid under Section 376 IPC and the Trial Court after examining PW-1(prosecutrix), PW2-Kumari Uma, sister of the prosecutrix, PW3 - mother of the prosecutrix, medical evidence of PW4-Dr.A Banerji and PW5- Dr.H.K.Premi, PW11- Dr.L.R. Verma and found the respondent-Asha Ram guilty under Section 376 IPC and sentenced him to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 5 years and a fine of Rs.1000/- and in default rigorous imprisonment for 3 months. Aggrieved thereby the respondent preferred an appeal before the High Court registered as Criminal Appeal No.6 of 1994. By the impugned order Justice R.L. Khurana (since retired) acquitted the accused on a perverse finding against all canon of justice. Hence this appeal by special leave by the State of Himachal Pradesh. The High Court after examining the prosecution evidence and documents on record acquitted the accused after recording the following findings:- \"From the evidence coming on record, it is not established that PW 1 was subjected to sexual intercourse on the night intervening 23/24.8.1988. No spermatozoa were found on the salwar and underwear of the prosecutrix, though according to the prosecution, complete act of sexual intercourse was committed. No spermatozoa were also found on the clothes of the accused. No evidence has come on the record to show that hymen was ruptured and if ruptured, the same was afresh rupture. The medical evidence coming on record, as discussed above, is highly unreliable and even otherwise it does not establish that PW 1 Kumari Seema was subjected to sexual intercourse.\"", "statute": ["s4"]}, "2007.INSC.293.txt": {"doc_url": "http://www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/2007/293.html", "explanation": {"The doctor found whitish substance near vulva of the deceased.

A written report (Exhibit Ka.1) was submitted at the Polic Station Kotwali. This was on 31.7.79 at 6.10 pm. The written report was submitted by the complainant, Samay Singh (PW.1). In the report it was stated that when the complainant returned home in village Tatarpur from his duty, he enquired from his younger daughter about the whereabouts of his elder daughter Asha (since deceased). The complainant was informed that Asha had gone to answer nature's call. The complainant also enquired from his wife, Brahma Devi (PW.2), about Asha. He was told by his wife that Asha had gone to answer nature's call. However, Asha did not return for considerable time. The complainant became suspicious. He proceeded to search out his daughter Asha at 5 pm. When the complainant reached the maize field of Kanchi he saw a chappal belonging to Asha lying near the boundary of the field. The complainant entered into the field. He found the dead body of his daughter Asha inside the field. A Dhoti was tied around her neck and another chappal was found lying near the dead body of Asha. Her clothes were blood stained. The complainant further found that the golden ear-rings of Asha were missing from her body. Asha was around 20 years old. On the basis of Ex. Ka.1 the Head Constable prepared the F.I.R. The case was registered. The entry was made in G.D. report. The I.O. recorded the statement of the complainant at the police station. He then proceeded to the site of occurrence. On reaching the field of Kanchi the I.O. found the dead body of Asha lying in the field with a Dhoti tied around her neck. The I.O. prepared the inquest report (Ex. Ka.5). He prepared the naqsha (Ex.Ka.7). The I.O., after completing the formalities, handed over the dead body of Asha to constables Bhojvir Singh and Rajvir Singh for post mortem at the district hospital, Bulandshahr. The possession of the chappal was also taken vide Ex.Ka.9. The I.O. inspected the spot on 1.8.79. He prepared the site plan. On 21.8.79 on interrogation Jamil (accused no.2) confessed his guilt. He also promised to get the golden ear-rings recovered from the shop of sarraf. He took the I.O. to the shop of the sarraf. The ear-rings were mortgaged with the sarraf. The name of sarraf was Ram Kishan (PW. 9). After going through the register Ram Kishan took the ear-rings. The ear-rings were taken into custody vide Ex.Ka.4. They were sealed in the presence of Jai Prakash Sharma (PW.10). The necessary formalities were thereafter completed. The ear-rings recovered from the shop were identified on 28.9.79. On 1.8.79 the post mortem was conducted. According to Dr. Surendra Pal Singh, Medical Superintendent (PW.14), the death was caused by strangulation. The doctor found whitish substance near vulva of the deceased. He prepared a slide and forwarded it to the pathologist. The doctor opined that Asha was possibly raped. After completing due investigation, the I.O. submitted the charge-sheet. The three accused \u0016 Akhlaq (Accused-1), Jamil (Accused-2) and Imtiyaz (Accused-3) denied the charges. They pleaded non-guilty. The prosecution examined 19 witnesses. 3) was present at the house of Babu at that time. Babu, Imtiyaz and Jamil saw Asha going towards the field of Kanchi followed by Akhlaq. They followed Akhlaq. Akhlaq and Asha entered into the maize field. Babu, Imtiyaz and Jamil followed Akhlaq. They saw Akhlaq having sexual intercourse with Asha. Babu, Jamil and Imtiayaz demanded sexual intercourse which Asha refused. Thereafter, Babu and Jamil forcibly had sexual intercourse with Asha.

The factual matrix of the case is as follows: A Notification under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 was issued on 14th September, 1977 for the purpose of acquiring land measuring 36 acres situated at Glenmire Estate, cosycot and cosynook in Mussoorie. The acquisition was so made for the purpose of extension of Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration, Mussoorie. Thereafter follow up Notification under Section 6 of the L.A.Act was issued on 30th January, 1978 which was also published. The possession of the land was taken over on 3rd July, 1986. The Special Land Acquisition Officer, after hearing the parties passed the award on 27th November, 1984 determining the amount of compensation at Rs.4,89,615.75. 4. Col. Jai Krishan (since deceased) represented by Lrs. (appellant herein) and Mahesh Chandra- respondent no.8, got filed reference under Section 18 of the L.A. Act. The said reference No. L.A.154 of 1985 heard by the Additional District Judge, Dehradun. The aforesaid claimants alleged before the Reference Court that considering the fact that Mussoorie is a famous tourist place, its land is of immense potential value, the market value of the land in question is Rs.25 lakh per acre. As such they claimed compensation for 36 acres of acquired land. They further claimed that the value of the constructed building cannot be assessed less than Rs. 100/- per sq. feet and, therefore, considering the plinth area of 3786 sq. feet of Glenmire building, 2528 sq. ft. of Cosynook building and other construction, the valuation should be Rs.6,31,400/- and after deducting the amount on account of depreciation factor the value of building is Rs. 4,73,550/-. There were 6990 trees on the aforesaid 36 acres of land. The claimants also submitted before the reference court that considering the fact that value of the trees which has been assessed @ Rs.15/- per tree, should have been at least Rs.50/- per tree. In reply, the stand of the State of U.P. was that the claimants have already claimed Rs.7,50,000/- as compensation for the acquired land and as such they are not entitled to claim any amount more than that. It was further pleaded that the land being sloppy and uneven as such it cannot be assessed more than Rs.5,000/- per acre. The respondents based their claim on the basis of the rate shown in exemplar sale deed dated 26th December, 1976. 7. The claimants also claimed 12% additional compensation u/s 23(1A) of the L.A. Act, which the Court below had not granted. The claimants also claimed that they were entitled to receive a sum of Rs. 7,01,875/- towards Fuel value/Timber value of the tree standing on the acquired land as approved by the retired Forest Ranger. They also pleaded that the compensation having been paid after more than one year from the date on which possession was taken, they are entitled for interest @ 15% per annum as provided under proviso to Section 28 of the L.A. Act. Such claim was made by the appellant and another by means of cross-objections. However, the High Court without deliberating on such issues as raised in the cross objections passed the impugned judgment.

Withholding such an evidence would give rise to draw an adverse inference against the prosecution. Secondly, the school certificate could not be relied upon as it was not a strong and material evidence.

The sentence of the appellant was enhanced to 5 years R.I. and a fine of Rs. 1000/- and in default further R.I. for 3 months. Aggrieved thereby, the present appeals have been filed by special leave. The factual matrix may be noted briefly: The prosecutrix \u0016 Kumari Pushpa at the relevant time was residing with her parents Pandurang \u0016 PW-1 and Vimal \u0016 PW-13 at Khar Danda, Mumbai. The accused was known to the prosecutrix as they were residing in the same locality. The accused was also a friend of the maternal uncle of the prosecutrix. She used to visit her maternal uncle's house where she used to meet the accused. Pandurang, father of the prosecutrix was admitted at K.E.M. Hospital for treatment of his eyes. The prosecutrix used to take food and tea to the hospital for her father. On 10th July, 1980, the prosecutrix had gone to the hospital at about 11.00 A.M. carrying food and tea for her father. She left the hospital at about 3.30 P.M. While she was coming out of the gate of the K.E.M. hospital, the accused who was a taxi driver met her at the gate and inquired as to where she was going. The prosecutrix told the accused that she was on her way to her residence. The accused told her that he had his own taxi and he would drop her at her residence at Danda. Upon such offer, the prosecutrix got into the taxi. When the taxi came to the Linking Road Junction, the accused told her that his wife was admitted in Nanawati Hospital and he would go and see his wife in the hospital and thereafter he would drop her at her residence. The accused then took the taxi to a small hotel representing that it was Nanawati Hospital. The accused took her inside the room of the hotel, bolted the room from inside and committed rape on her by threatening that in case of her shouting, she would be finished. Both of them came out of the hotel room and the accused dropped her home at 5.45 P.M. in his own taxi. The prosecutrix reached home bleeding profusely from her private parts. After half an hour, she became unconscious. Her mother Vimal \u0016 PW-13 and her brother Eknath took her in a taxi to Bhabha Hospital. She was examined by Dr. Dilip Chaniary \u0016 PW-12 of Bhabha Hospital. After she regained consciousness at about 10.00 P.M. she narrated the incident to her mother that she was raped at about 5 P.M. and told that she was bleeding from her vagina since 5.30 P.M. PW-15, S.I. Bagal, who was attached to Bandra Police Station was intimated about the incident on telephone. PW-15, alongwith a Police Constable, reached Bhabha Hospital for inquiry. He contacted the prosecutrix in the ward. He also questioned her about the incident and recorded her statement. He also recorded the statements of her mother Vimal and brother Eknath. He further made inquiry about the age of the girl from the brother and mother of the prosecutrix. Thereafter, he went to the school where she studied last and collected the school leaving certificate from Khar Upper Municipal School on 11th July, 1980. PW-15 did not register any case presumably thinking that the age recorded in the school leaving certificate was more than 16 years and she was a consenting party to sex. He was of the view that there was not enough material to register a case. He also stated that he called the accused for further inquiry on 3-4 occasions but did not think it necessary to register the offence or to carry further investigations. The conduct of PW-15, S.I. Bagal has been commented upon and deprecated by both the Trial Court and the High Court, which we may refer at an appropriate stage, if need be. May be for any reason, best known to him, PW-15, S.I. Bagal did not register the offence, but we are shocked to note that in a grievous offence like rape being reported to the police, the concerned police officer did not register the case despite the fact that the prosecutrix had categorically stated that the accused had forcible sexual intercourse with her which no doubt would lead to the losing of confidence of the public in the police establishment. When the matter stood thus, an unexpected development had taken place. PW-5, Kashinath, a friend of the father of the prosecutrix informed Pandurang (PW-1) in the K.E.M. Hospital about the incident. He was shocked to hear the same and after confirming the same from his wife Vimal and daughter Pushpa, against the medical advice, he got himself discharged from the hospital on 9th September, 1980 and made an application dated 23rd September, 1980 to the Commissioner of Police, copies of which were also sent to the Prime Minister of India and the Chief Minister of the State. After receiving the application dated 23rd September, 1980, the Commissioner of Police forwarded the papers to A.C.P. Rodriques who took away the investigations from S.I. Bagal and directed PW-14, S.I. Parab to re-investigate the matter.", "statute": ["s4"]}, "2015.INSC.467.txt": {"doc_url": "http://www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/2015/467.html", "explanation": {" the prosecutrix was shown as under-aged ": ["s4"]}, "fact": "2. The facts of the present matter are that on 03.01.2003, at about 10:30 A.M. the prosecutrix was going to school along with her sister. On realizing that she had left behind her practical note book, she returned back and after taking the said note book she once again headed towards the school. When she reached near Tar Badi (wire fencing) near Hawai Patti, there was an Ambassador car standing there and as alleged, the accused respondent came out of the car, pulled the prosecutrix inside the car and forced her to smell something, as a result of which the prosecutrix became unconscious. As alleged by the prosecution, the prosecutrix was taken to some unknown place thereafter. 3. On regaining consciousness, the prosecutrix felt pain in her private parts. On the same day, she was admitted in the District Hospital, Satna in an unconscious condition and information about the incident was given to Laxmikant Sharma (P.W.8), the uncle of the prosecutrix. On 10.01.2003, the prosecutrix was discharged from the Hospital and sent back to her home where she narrated the incident and thereafter an F.I.R was lodged. During the course of investigation, the prosecutrix was sent for medical examination and her clothes were seized and slides were prepared. After receipt of the medical report, F.I.R was registered and site map of the spot was prepared. The Investigating Officer seized various articles which included the prosecutrix\u2019s birth certificate and certificate of the Middle School Examination, 2001. Along with that the relevant page (page No. 20) of the register of the U.S.A Hotel was also seized. After due investigation a charge-sheet was filed against the respondent for offences under Sections 363, 366 and 376 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (\u201cI.P.C.\u201d) and the statements of the prosecution witnesses were recorded. 4. On 27.03.2003, the Judicial Magistrate, First Class Satna registered the Criminal Case No.116/2003 and passed the committal order. Accordingly, the case was transferred and was received by the Upper District Sessions Judge-III, Satna for trial. 6. Aggrieved by the aforesaid judgment and order passed by the IIIrd Additional Sessions Judge, Satna, the respondent preferred an appeal under Section 374(2) of Cr.P.C. before the High Court of Madhya Pradesh at Jabalpur, which was numbered as Criminal Appeal No.924 of 2006. The learned Single Judge of the High Court, by impugned judgment and order dated 10.07.2008, set aside the judgment and order of conviction passed by the Trial Court against the respondent. The High Court ruled that the decision of the Trial Court was not sustainable solely on the ground that the prosecution had failed to prove the fact that the girl was less than 16 years of age at the time of the incident. The reasons that weighed heavily with the ruling of the High Court were that, either the public prosecutor or P.W.7 Pramod Kumar Sharma (father of the prosecutrix) tried to file Ext. P/5 which was not part of the charge-sheet. Such type of evidence could not be created by any person except the Investigation Officer. It was for the prosecution to show that a particular document was taken on record during investigation but could not be filed. The prosecution could not create any new evidence which was not part of the investigation. Ext. P/5 and Ext. P/6 have variation in the date of birth of the prosecutrix. In certificate Ext.P/5 the date of birth was disclosed as 29.8.1987, whereas in certificate Ext.P/6 it has been disclosed as 27.8.1987. The High Court found this sufficient to disbelieve that the prosecutrix was below 16 years of age at the time of the incident. The High Court relied on the statement of PW-11 Dr. A.K. Saraf who took the X-ray of the prosecutrix and on the basis of the ossification test, came to the conclusion that the age of the prosecutrix was more than 15 years but less than 18 years. Considering this the High Court presumed that the girl was more than 18 years of age at the time of the incident. The last ground taken by the High Court was that the girl was a consenting party and was more than 18 years of age at the time of the incident and thus, no offence against the accused has been proved.", "statute": ["s4"]}, "2008.INSC.1010.txt": {"doc_url": "http://www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/2008/1010.html", "explanation": {" forcibly raped her ": ["s4"]}, "fact": "2. Background facts in a nutshell are as follows: First Information Report was lodged on 27.11.1997 by mother of the victim, aged about 6 years, alleging that the appellant had taken the victim to a lonely place and forcibly raped her on 25.11.1997. The victim suffered terrible pain. Persons of the locality tried to intervene in the matter and there was some delay in lodging the FIR. Investigation was undertaken and charge sheet was filed for alleged commission of offence punishable under Section 376 IPC. The victim was examined as PW-6 while her mother, the informant was examined as PW-4. The trial Court and the High Court relied on the evidence of PWs 4 and 6 to hold the appellant guilty of offence punishable under Section 376 read with Section 511 IPC and sentenced him as afore-noted. The appeal before the High Court did not bring any result.  The basic challenge in this appeal appears to be that the evidence of the child witness should not have been accepted particularly in the absence of any corroboration. It has also been indicated that the sentence is harsh. Learned counsel for the State has urged that the testimony of a child witness particularly in case of this nature does not require corroboration if the testimony of the victim is credible.

The writ petition before us shows that the ordeal of the petitioner began in the year 2010 when the father and her family alleged to have started coercing her to join the flesh trade/prostitution. Upon realizing petitioner's unwillingness, father and the family tried to sell her off to an elderly man of about 65 to 70 years in Punjab. Upon becoming aware of the nefarious designs of the accused persons, petitioner somehow managed to escape from her parental home in Meerut and escaped to Haridwar, from where she was brought back by some Samaritans to the office of DIG Meerut, where she narrated her ordeal. Petitioner was sent to the custody of her parents with a stern warning, which was not complied. As such, she was then given into the custody of Ms. Asha Madho, who was an ex-teacher of the petitioner. However, in the midnight of 1/2.9.2011 in the absence of the custodian, her parents along with their relatives with police assistance said to have forcibly took her away. Thereafter, petitioner complained to the Police that she was held in captivity by her father and anything can happen to her in such circumstances. Taking action on the said letter, the SHO produced the petitioner before the City Magistrate on 5.9.2011, where the petitioner stated that she was a major and should be allowed to stay free as per her wishes and her custody should not be given to her father and family. Father of the petitioner also moved an application before the City Magistrate stating that his daughter was mentally unstable on which an order was passed to refer the petitioner to a hospital for mental medical examination, in which she was declared mentally sound. The City Magistrate passed an order giving the custody of the petitioner to Ms. Asha Madho. It was also ordered that Ms. Asha Madho will produce the petitioner before the Court as and when required. 3. Aggrieved by the order, father of the petitioner preferred a Revision Petition before the Additional District Judge, Meerut seeking custody of the petitioner. Petitioner was produced before the court and when being asked about her choice, she refused to go with her father and told the court that her father had earlier raped her and wanted to sell her. By way of a letter Ms. Asha Madho showed her unwillingness to take custody of the petitioner on the ground of her own sickness and criminal background of petitioner's parents. Hence, the petitioner further showed her desire to go along with Ms. Aparna Gautam, sister-in-law of Ms. Asha Madho. On 15.10.2011, the Additional District Judge partly allowed the revision petition and set aside order dated 16.9.2011 regarding the custody of the petitioner being given to Ms. Asha Madho and held that the petitioner being an adult is free to reside wherever she decides to live. 4. It is alleged by the petitioner that after the Court had risen, accused persons forcibly dragged her out of the Court and took her to various places within Meerut and thereafter to Ludhiyana, Punjab, and throughout this period the petitioner was repeatedly assaulted and raped by her father and his accomplices. Subsequently, in November 2011, Mrs. Aparna Gautam filed a writ of Habeas Corpus before the Allahabad High Court. Consequently, the petitioner was produced before the High Court on 16.1.2012, where she gave details of assault, rape and abduction. On 30.1.2012, consequent to petitioner's statement, learned Single Judge of the High Court disposed of the writ petition setting her at liberty to go anywhere including the opportunity to go along with Mrs. Aparna Gautam. 5. On several occasions the petitioner tried to lodge a FIR with regard to abduction, repeated assault and rape while she was in illegal custody of the respondents. On 16.1.2013, the petitioner wrote a complaint to the SSP Meerut, Uttar Pradesh for registering her FIR against the respondents. On 21.01.2013, finally FIR No.31/2013 was registered against the respondents under Sections 366, 323, 504 and 376 of IPC at Lisadi Gate Police Station, Meerut instead of Civil Lines Police Station. 10. In compliance of the aforesaid order, the petitioner appeared before the Chief Judicial Magistrate and her statement was recorded and the same was forwarded to this Court. We have gone through the statement made by the petitioner before the Chief Judicial Magistrate. In her statement, she has made serious allegations against her father allegedly committing rape since 2007. She also stated that when she was residing with her Asha Madam, her parents along with many persons including Police personnel (which did not have any lady police) forcibly took her away from there to the Police Station, from where she was handed over to her parents. She stated that her parents used to misbehave with her. She has also stated that on 15.10.2011, after the decision of the Magistrate declaring her major and could reside at her will, her aunt Anjana Malik and Ranjana Vasudeva dragged her outside Court, where more than 15 persons were present including her father Ravinder Behl, Safar Borga, Ravinder Singh, Advocate, Tarun Behl, Reeta Behl, Roma Behl, Sanjay Aggarwal, Dharamveer Narang, Inderjeet, Harvinder Singh, Harsh Behl, Rakesh Vasudeva and all of them including police personnel took her dragging up to the main door of the Court and put her in white colour Santro Car, which had been driven by Pawan Malik. 11. In her statement she has alleged that she was kidnapped and taken to the house of her aunt (Bhuwa) and then to the house of Harsh Behl, where she was abused and her father forcing her for prostitution told that in their business goods once sold is never taken back and they are bound to hand it over dead or alive. Harsh Behl stated to her that they would have also kidnapped Aparna Gautam if gathering would not have saved her. Thereafter, Harsh Behl raped her. She has also alleged sexual assault by Dharamveer Narang, Constable Dayashankar, DIG Prem Prakash, Manish Mishra, Sunny Ahuja, Deshraj Ahuja, Tilak Narang and Toofan alias Raj Kumar. She amended her statement saying that name of Manish Mishra was taken by mistake as he was not present there and the name of the man was Dr. B.P. Ashok. She has also alleged that on 17.10.2010 Inderjeet and Harvinder raped her in the presence of Preety Khurana and Urmila Kathuria, who did not save her despite repeated prayer. Thereafter, she was taken to Ludhiyana, where as alleged by her, father used to rape her. Upon filing of Habeas Corpus petition by Aparna Gautam, she was produced by her parents in the High Court, where she stated that she did not want to go with her parents since she was being raped by her father and his accomplices. She has also alleged that when Aparna Gautam had gone to DIG with a request letter to meet petitioner, DIG physically assaulted her and when she was conversing with Media at the Commissioner Square, she was taken away by the police and implicated her in false case and was also imprisoned. She has submitted that many I.Os. have changed and despite various letters written by her, no I.O. turned up even on 18.3.2014, when she was sitting in the Chambers of her advocate in the Saket Courts. However, when her advocate had gone to attend other case, her parents entered into the Chamber and threatened her to keep quite. She stated that her Parvikar Aparna Gautam is being harassed since she helped her. 12. As noticed above, as against the order passed by the City Magistrate on 5.9.2011, before whom the petitioner has stated that she was a major and should be allowed to stay free as per her wishes, the father of the petitioner filed a revision petition before the Additional District Judge,Meerut seeking custody of the petitioner on the ground that she was mentally unstable. The Additional District Judge by setting aside the order of the City Magistrate regarding custody of the petitioner being given to Mrs. Asha Madho held that the petitioner being an adult is free to reside where she decides to live. The City Magistrate, before passing the aforesaid order, got the petitioner medically examined in which she was declared mentally sound. The Additional District Judge in revisional order had observed that the father of the petitioner made a false statement that the petitioner was mentally unfit.", "statute": ["s4"]}, "2006.INSC.502.txt": {"doc_url": "http://www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/2006/502.html", "explanation": {"Thereafter, Lalit Gupta committed rape on the prosecutrix against her wish and without her consent which was followed by Ashok Kumar who also defiled her.

Accused-Lalit Gupta was after her and also promised to marry her. On 2nd February, 1987 at about 6.30 p.m., the prosecutrix had gone to the market of Sector 19. Accused- Lalit Gupta met her in the market and invited her to the house of his cousin so that the proposal regarding marriage could be discussed with his relations. On this, the prosecutrix agreed to accompany him to Sector 38, Chandigarh. Lalit Gupta hired a three-wheeler scooter (auto-rickshaw) and they proceeded towards Sector 38. In the midway, the auto- rickshaw was got stopped by Lalit Gupta and accused-Ashok Kumar alias Babbu also boarded the auto-rickshaw. When the prosecutrix, Lalit Gupta and Ashok Kumar entered the house, another accused-Inderjit Singh, who was acquitted by the High Court, met them there.

Both the accused and the prosecutrix belong to Scheduled Caste. On 5th of May, 1991, between 00 and 00 p.m. while the prosecutrix and her brother, Rameah were playing in the Chavani of their house, the respondent went there and called out for Honnaiah, PW-4, father of the prosecutrix. Parvathi, PW-5 was at that time preparing chapatees in the kitchen. She answered back to say that her husband was not in the house. On hearing this, the respondent went inside the house and asked Parvathi. PW-5 to sleep with him, since her husband was not present in the house. She protested. The respondent made obscene gestures and pulled her breasts and on her further protest, the respondent beat her up. Parvathi, PW-5 managed to somehow escape and ran out of the house and went towards the house of her mother-in-law, Ramajji. Both the prosecutrix and her brother, after observing the incident also made an attempt to run away. The respondent, however, caught hold of the prosectrix by her right hand and dragged her to room no.3 of houses in coolie line. The respondent closed the door and forcibly made prosecutrix to lie on the floor.

She also disclosed enough materials to show that she had the occasion to see the accused persons at least on three occasions almost immediately prior to the commission of offence and also when she was intercepted and forcibly committed sexual assault on her. It is further borne out from records that immediately upon hearing her cries when the appellants allegedly took to heels, her brother P.W. 6 Rambabu saw the appellants running away from the spot.

As per the prosecution, accused Zindar Ali SK was trying to marry with prosecuterix Chandmoni Khatoon with the help of Naki Mollick. Prosecuterix was working as a weaver and on the day of incident, when she was returning from her work, the accused caught her, taking advantage of the dark and committed rape on her. The prosecution further alleged that Naki Mollick abetted the commission of the offence and both the accused persons threatened to kill her. The accused committed rape on the prosecuterix several times forcibly and had also falsely assured to marry her. However, the accused refused to marry the complainant/prosecuterix and, therefore, the prosecuterix informed the incident to her family members and neighbours. Salish (a meeting for resolving the dispute) was held in the Village on 24.2.2003, wherein, it was decided that the accused should marry the prosecuterix, however, Zindar Ali refused to marry the prosecuterix. A complaint seems to have been made to the Chief Judicial Magistrate who issued a direction on 10.7.2003 to the police to register an offence. This became necessary as though she had approached the police, they advised her to settle the matter amicably with accused. Ultimately, a Chargesheet was submitted for offences under Sections 376, 417 and 120-B of IPC. However, it was found that the other accused Naki Mollick was a juvenile and his trial, therefore, was separated. As many as 14 witnesses were examined by the prosecution in support of the prosecution case, including the prosecuterix, her father and mother. Some documents were also filed, including the medical reports, age reports etc. Doctors were also examined and ultimately, the accused abjured the guilt and claimed that he had been falsely implicated, as he had refused to marry the prosecuterix. Ultimately, the Sessions Judge negatived the defence and came to the conclusion that the offences of rape and cheating were proved against the accused, and convicted him on those two counts, however, he was acquitted of the charge under Section 120-B of IPC. 4.

The factual position on which the prosecution version is founded, commences with the passing of information by Savitri Devi (the mother of the prosecutrix VW - PW6), to her husband Jagdish Chander-PW8, on 26.3.1993, at about 6 am. She informed her husband, that the prosecutrix VW - PW6 was missing from their residence. In this behalf it would be pertinent to mention, that on 25.3.1993 at about 10 pm, Jagdish Chander went to sleep in the \u201cbaithak\u201d (drawing room) of their residence. Savitri Devi, the mother of the prosecutrix VW - PW6, along with the prosecutrix VW - PW6, and the other children (comprising of three sons, the prosecutrix VW \u2013 PW6 and one other daughter), went to sleep in the other rooms of the house. Savitri Devi, told her husband, that she suspected the accused- appellant Jarnail Singh, may be responsible for having taken away their daughter. 2. Jagdish Chander-PW8, commenced to search for his daughter. During the course of the aforesaid search, the accused-appellant Jarnail Singh, who had his residence in the neighbourhood (of Jagdish Chander-PW8), was also found missing from his residence. The search for the prosecutrix VW - PW6 by her father, proved futile. It is therefore, that Jagdish Chander- PW8, made a complaint Exhibit PO on 27.3.1993 to the Sub-Inspector Incharge, Police Post, Jathlana. In his complaint, he described VW - PW6, as the elder of his two daughters. He gave out her age as about 16 years. He also alleged, that his daughter VW - PW6 had gone missing from their residence in the night intervening 25th and 26th March, 1993. He also alleged, that an amount of Rs.3,000/- was missing from his house, which he assumed may have been taken away by his daughter VW - PW6, while leaving the house. In the complaint Exhibit PO, the needle of suspicion was pointed at the accused-appellant Jarnail Singh. 3. After the registration of the complaint of Jagdish Chander-PW8, the prosecutrix VW - PW6 was recovered on 29.3.1983, from the custody of the accused-appellant Jarnail Singh, from the house of Shashi Bhan at Raipur in district Haridwar. The accused-appellant simultaneously came to be arrested, on 29.3.1993. 4. The statement of the prosecutrix VW - PW6 was got recorded under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure before O.P. Verma, Judicial Magistrate First Class, Jagadhri on 6.4.1993. It is necessary in the facts and circumstances of this case to extract herein her short statement recorded under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which is being reproduced hereunder: \u201cStated that on the night of 25.3.1993 at around 11 pm, I went to a street near my house to answer nature\u2019s call. Accused Jarnail Singh and his three accomplices were hiding there. When I got up after answering nature\u2019s call, then they caught hold of me and inhaled me something by cloth, due to which, I got unconscious. They took me to some unknown place in U.P. by putting me in some vehicle. There they took me to a room. Jarnail Singh, forcibly committed wrong (intercourse) with me. I slapped on his face, then he put cloth in my mouth. Therefore, I could not raise noise. Thereafter, everyone committed forcible intercourse with me, turn by turn. Huge blood came out of my vagina, and I felt a lot of pain. Thereafter, police caught us and handed over me to my parents.\u201d 5. On completion of investigation, a challan was presented under Sections 366, 376 and 120 of the Indian Penal Code. The matter was committed to the Court of Sessions, Jagadhri, whereupon, it was marked to the Additional Sessions Judge, Jagadhri. The Additional Sessions Judge, Jagadhri framed charges on 20.12.1993. The accused-appellant pleaded not guilty, and claimed trial. 6. In order to bring home the charges levelled against the accused- appellant, the prosecution examined 9 witnesses. Thereafter, the prosecution evidence was closed. The statement of the accused-appellant Jarnail Singh, was then recorded under Section 313 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. He denied the allegations levelled against him, and pleaded false implication. Despite opportunity having been afforded to him, the accused-appellant did not lead any evidence, in his defence. 7. It is necessary to record, that on the culmination of the trial, the Additional Sessions Judge, Jagadhri arrived at the conclusion, that the prosecution had been able to bring home the guilt of the accused-appellant beyond any shadow of reasonable doubt, under Sections 366, 376(g) and 120-B of the Indian Penal Code. The accused-appellant Jarnail Singh was accordingly held guilty of the charges levelled against him. The Additional Sessions Judge, Jagadhri gave an opportunity of hearing to the accused-appellant Jarnail Singh on the question of sentence. Thereupon, for the offence under Section 376(g) of the Indian Penal Code the accused- appellant was awarded rigorous imprisonment for 10 years, he was also required to pay a fine of Rs.200/- (in case of default in payment of fine, the accused-appellant was to undergo further rigorous imprisonment for 3 months). For the offence under Section 366 of the Indian Penal Code, the accused-appellant was awarded rigorous imprisonment for 7 years, and was required to pay a fine of Rs.150/- (in case of default in payment of fine, the accused-appellant was to undergo further rigorous imprisonment for 3 months). And for the offence under Section 120-B of the Indian Penal Code, the accused-appellant was awarded rigorous imprisonment for 7 years, and was required to pay a fine of Rs.150/- (in case of default in payment of fine, the accused-appellant was to undergo further rigorous imprisonment for 3 months). The aforesaid sentences were ordered to run concurrently. 8. Dissatisfied with the judgment dated 14.3.1995, rendered by the trial Court, the accused-appellant Jarnail Singh preferred Criminal Appeal no. 247-SB of 1995 before the Punjab & Haryana High Court at Chandigarh (hereinafter referred to as, the High Court). The High Court dismissed the appeal preferred by the accused-appellant on 4.11.2008. The judgment of conviction dated 14.3.1995 and the order of sentence dated 15.3.1995 (rendered by the trial Court i.e., the Additional Sessions Judge, Jagadhri) were upheld. 9. Dissatisfied with the judgment of the trial Court dated 14.3.1995 and that of the appellate Court dated 4.11.2008, the accused-appellant Jarnail Singh approached this Court. On 7.7.2010, this Court granted leave, in the Petition for Special Leave to Appeal (Crl.) no. 7836 of 2009, filed by the accused-appellant. Having traversed the aforesaid course, the instant criminal appeal has finally been placed before us, for adjudication. (iii) The prosecution then examined Moti Ram as PW3. Moti Ram testified, that he was present when the prosecutrix VW - PW6, was recovered whilst in custody of the accused-appellant, from the house of Shashi Bhan at Raipur, in district Haridwar. Moti Ram also affirmed the presence of Om Prakash, Jagmal and Sumer Chand, along with the police party, at the time of recovery of the prosecutrix VW - PW6, on 29.3.1993. Moti Ram had identified the prosecutrix VW - PW6, at the time of her said recovery. (v) The prosecutrix appeared as PW6 before the trial Court. She affirmed the factual position expressed by her father Jagdish Chander-PW8 in his complaint dated 27.3.1993 (Exhibit PO). She also reiterated the factual position expressed by her, in her statement, recorded under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, on 6.4.1993. In sum and substance she asserted, that she had studied upto class 3 at the Government High School, Jathlana, whereafter, she started to do household work at home. On 25.3.1993 at about 11 pm, she had gone out of her house to urinate in the street. The accused-appellant Jarnail Singh and three other persons had caught hold of her, and had taken her in a tanker towards Raipur side in Uttar Pradesh. The accused- appellant Jarnail Singh and his three accomplices, had then raped her in a small room. She also testified, that she had been recovered by the police from Raipur, and at the time of her recovery, Moti Ram-PW3 and her uncle Omilal (Om Prakash) and Jagmal were present with the police party. Thereafter, she claims to have been brought to police post Jathlana, and was got medico-legally examined by a lady doctor at Civil Hospital, Radaur. Since the prosecutrix VW - PW6, was not disclosing the entire factual position, and seemed to be changing the version of her statement recorded under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the Public Prosecutor sought permission to cross-examine her. Consequent upon being permitted to cross- examine the prosecutrix VW - PW6, she affirmed, that the accused- appellant had been alluring her for marriage, with the promise of giving her ornaments and clothes, and a further commitment to move her to the city, after their marriage. During these allurements, the accused-appellant Jarnail Singh used to also impress upon her, that her parents were poor and would marry her to some poor person, who would never be able to provide her such facilities. During her cross-examination, she expressly denied the suggestion, that she herself had allured the accused- appellant Jarnail Singh, to take her away, in order to marry him. 15. In so far as the issue of having gone with the accused-appellant Jarnail Singh of her own free will, and of having had sexual intercourse with him consensually, it is necessary only to examine the uncontested deposition of the prosecutrix VW - PW6. In this behalf, it may be pointed out, that in her statement recorded under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure before the Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Jagadhari on 6.4.1993, the prosecutrix VW \u2013 PW6 had expressly asserted, that she was forcibly taken away on 25.3.1993, when she had gone out of her house to urinate in the street, by Jarnail Singh and his three accomplices. She had clearly and categorically testified, that all the four had caught hold of her. They had made her inhale something, which rendered her unconscious. She had further stated, that the accused-appellant Jarnail Singh and his accomplices, had then taken her to some unknown place in Uttar Pradesh in a vehicle where Jarnail Singh forcibly attempted to commit intercourse with her. At that juncture, she had slapped Jarnail Singh on his face, but in order to subjugate her, he had put a cloth in her mouth to prevent her from raising an alarm. Thereafter, the accused-appellant Jarnail Singh and his accomplices had committed forcible intercourse with her, one after the other. In her statement before the Trial Court, where she appeared as PW6, she had reiterated clearly the position of having been taken away by the accused-appellant Jarnail Singh, and his three accomplices. She affirmed, that she was taken away in a tanker to Uttar Pradesh and then all the accused had committed rape on her in a small room. On the aforestated aspect of the matter, she was not subjected to cross-examination at the behest of the accused. Only a suggestion was put to her, that she had persuaded the accused-appellant Jarnail Singh to take her away, in order to perform marriage with her, and for the said purpose had taken away cash, clothes and jewellery from her own residence. The aforestated suggestion was denied by the prosecutrix VW - PW6. Keeping in view the statement of the prosecutrix VW - PW6 under Section 164 of the code of Criminal procedure before the Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Jagadhri, as also, the statement made by her while appearing before the trial court, and the manner in which she was subjected to cross-examination, there is no room for any doubt, that the prosecutrix was forcefully taken away, and that, she was subjected to rape at the hands of the accused-appellant Jarnail Singh and his three accomplices. It may still have been understandable, if the case had been, that she had consensual sex with the accused-appellant alone. But consensual sex with four boys at the same time, is just not comprehensible. Since the fact, that the accused-appellate Jarnail Singh and the prosecutrix VW \u2013 PW6 had eloped together is not disputed. And furthermore, since the accused-appellant having had sexual intercourse with the prosecutrix is also the disputed. It is just not possible to accept the proposition canvassed on behalf of the accused-appellant. We, therefore, find no merit in the instant submission. 16. The contention advanced at the hands of the learned counsel for the accused-appellant Jarnail Singh, that while leaving her house on 25.3.1993, the prosecutrix VW \u2013 PW6, had taken away a sum of Rs.3,000/-, needs a holistic examination. Whilst it is true that in the complaint, Jagdish Chandra (PW8), the father of the prosecutrix VW - PW6, had categorically mentioned that a sum of Rs.3,000/- was missing from his residence, and the said fact was duly mentioned in his complaint to the police dated 27.3.1993, yet he had not accuse the prosecutrix VW - PW6 for having taken it away. The instant aspect, in our considered view pales into insignificance, on account of the statement made by Jagdish Chandra (PW8) before the Trial Court. During the course of his deposition before the Trial Court, he had asserted, that he had mentioned that a sum of Rs.3,000/- was missing from his residence, but his wife Savitri Devi had found the aforesaid money from the residence itself, a few days later. Accordingly, the assertion made by the learned counsel representing the accused- appellant to the effect that the prosecutrix VW - PW6 had taken away a sum of Rs.3,000/-, when she left the house of her father on 25.3.1993, cannot be stated to have been duly proved. Besides the aforesaid, it is apparent from the cross-examination of the prosecutrix VW - PW6, that a suggestion was put to her that besides cash, she had taken away clothes and jewellery at the time of leaving her father\u2019s house on 25.3.1993. The prosecutrix VW 24. We have given our thoughtful consideration to the above noted submission, advanced at the hands of the learned counsel for the appellant. We, however, find no merit therein. It is not as if the prosecution version is entirely based on the statement of the prosecutrix VW - PW6. It would be relevant to mention, that her recovery from the custody of the accused-appellant Jarnail Singh from the house of Shashi Bhan, at Raipur, is sought to be established from the statement of Moti Ram-PW3. There can therefore be no room for any doubt, that after she was found missing from her father\u2019s residence on 25.3.1993, and after her father Jagdish Chandra- PW8 had made a complaint to the police on 27.3.1993, she was recovered from the custody of the accused-appellant Jarnail Singh. Thereafter, the prosecutrix VW - PW6 was subjected to medico-legal examination by Dr. Kanta Dhankar-PW1 on 29.3.1993 itself at 3.00 p.m. Dr. Kanta Dhankar-PW1, in her independent testimony, affirmed that she had been subjected to sexual intercourse, inasmuch as her hymen was found ruptured. Even though the visual examination of the prosecutrix VW \u2013 PW6, during the course of her medico-legal examination did not reveal the presence of semen or blood, yet the report of the forensic science laboratory (Exhibit PL) and of the Serologist (Exhibit PL/1) clearly establish the presence of semen on her salwar, underwear and pubic hair. The serologist\u2019s report also disclose, medium and small blood stains on her \u201csalwar\u201d. In her own deposition, she had mentioned that, when she was raped by the accused-appellant Jarnail Singh and his accomplices, bleeding had taken place and she had felt pain, and her clothes were stained with blood. Her deposition stands scientifically substantiated by Exhibits PL and PL/1. The suggestion put to the prosecutrix VW \u2013 PW6 at the behest of the accused-appellant Jarnail Singh, during the course of her cross-examination, that she had accompanied the accused-appellant Jarnail Singh, of her own free will and had had sexual intercourse with him consensually, leaves no room for any doubt, that she was in his company, and that, he had had sexual intercourse with her. The assertion that the prosecutrix VW \u2013 PW6 had accompanied the accused-appellant Jarnail Singh, and had had sexual intercourse with him consensually is completely ruled out, because as per the substantiated prosecution version, the prosecutrix VW - PW6 was not taken away by the accused-appellant Jarnail Singh alone, but also, by his three accomplices. All the four of them had similarly violated her person. Additionally, in her statement under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal procedure, the prosecutrix VW - PW6 had asserted, that in the first instance, after having caught hold of her, the accused had made her inhale something from a cloth which had made her unconscious. Thereafter, when the accused-appellant Jarnail Singh attempted to commit intercourse with her, she had slapped him. He had then put a cloth in her mouth, to stop her from raising an alarm. Thereafter, each one of the accomplices had committed forcible intercourse with her in turns. The factum of commission of forcible intercourse by the accused-appellant, as also, his accomplices was reiterated by her during her testimony before the Trial Court as PW6. Besides the aforesaid, there is a statement of her own father, Jagdish Chandra (PW8) who also in material particulars had corroborated the testimony of the prosecutrix VW - PW6. The prosecutrix VW \u2013 PW6, was not subjected to cross-examination on any of these issues. Nor was the prosecutrix confronted with either the statements made by her under Section 161 or Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Prosecution, so as to enable her to explain discrepancies, if any. Therefore, we find no merit at all, in the submission advanced by the learned counsel. In the above view of the matter, we are satisfied that there was substantial material corroborating the statement of the prosecutrix VW - PW6, for an unequivocal determination of the guilt of the accused-appellant Jarnail Singh.", "statute": ["s4"]}, "2011.INSC.893.txt": {"doc_url": "http://www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/2011/893.html", "explanation": {" repeatedly raped ": ["s4"], " medical examination who found that she had been subjected to recent sexual intercourse ": ["s4"]}, "fact": "1.

The trial court and the High Court have in addition relied on the evidence of P.W. 3 and P.W. 6, the parents of the victim P.W. 1, who have categorically stated that on the intervening night of 28th and 29th June, 1996, the prosecutrix had been sleeping inside their home when the appellants reached that place in a jeep armed with deadly weapons and they had told P.W. 6 to give his daughter as Crl.A. 112 of 2006 a wife to Ramjilal appellant and on his refusal he had been threatened by the appellants on which he had run away from the spot.

In the meantime, the accused had deposited the fine of Rs.40,000/- as ordered by the High Court and our of this amount a sum of Rs.25,000/- has been withdrawn by the father of the girl. Perhaps this was the consideration for the State Government not to file any appeal in the Supreme Court. Since there was no response from the State Government, Mr. P.D.

When the prosecutrix was going on the colony road at the intersection of this road and a bye-lane, which was a secluded spot, the accused caught-hold of her on the pretext that her assistance was required for pulling either the pipe or the wires in the Maruti car which was standing there. The girl was pushed inside the car. At that time she was wearing a midi-frock and a nicker. The accused pulled down her nicker and laid her on the seat in the car. She did try to resist by saying that she should be allowed to go and that she would be late in reaching home. The accused then opened the zip of his pant and started pressing his penis on her private part. When the girl cried that she would be late in reaching home, the accused said `wait', `one second'. According to her, thereafter the accused urinated. She felt wetness on her private part. After the girl was released she came home weeping. She embrached her father and narrated the whole incident to him. The parents of the girl examined her private part and the garments and noticed the sticky substance (semen) on some part of the midi-frock as well as on the nicker. There was redness on her private part. The girl described the person who committed such bashful act on her. Shrikant Deshpande, the father of the girl, took her on his scooter and came to the spot where the incident took place but there was no body. They returned home. The mother of the girl gave her bath and she went to her school as usual. Deshpande, however, did not stop at that and he made more enquiries. He went to the sport again and there then he was told by Vishakha Kulkarni, a college student, who was living in the vicinity that a Maruti Car of chocolate colour was seen there which bore registration No. MGR-942.

Dr. Gunda was the Medical Officer at Civil Hospital, Kolhapur and he examined the prosecutrix at 9 P.M. on September 24, 1986 itself. This he did on the basis of police `yadi'.

First, a brief reference to the prosecution case. The prosecutrix (name with-held by us), a young girl about 18 years of age, was staying with her parents in village Kothi, district Bilaspur, (H.P.). The accused, Rajinder@Raju, resident of village Duhak, district Bilaspur, had taken contract for laying G.I. Pipelines in (1996) 2 SCC 384 village Kothi near the residence of the prosecutrix. In that connection, he used to store his material in the house of prosecutrix' parents. On January 16, 1996, prosecutrix had some throat pain. When the accused came to the house of the prosecutrix and came to know that the prosecutrix has been suffering from throat pain, he suggested to the mother of the prosecutrix that his cousin at Ghumarwin was a doctor and if permitted, he could show the prosecutrix to his cousin. The mother of the prosecutrix agreed. The accused took the prosecutrix on his scooter at about 3.00 P.M. Instead of taking the prosecutrix to Ghumarwin, he took her to Jablu stating that he had to collect the rent from his tenants. From Jablu, the accused took prosecutrix to Berthin. The accused reached Berthin at about 8.00 - 8.30 P.M. alongwith the prosecutrix. At Berthin, the accused bought some sweets and told the prosecutrix that he would take her to his house as it was dark. The accused instead of taking her to his house, took the scooter to some kachha road and made her to get down from the scooter. After spreading his pattu on the ground and gagging the prosecutrix mouth made her lie down; untied her salwar and committed the sexual intercourse with her forcibly. The accused then left her leaving behind his pattu and torch. After the accused had left, the prosecutrix saw some light from a house down the road. She walked upto that house and told the lady, Smt. Bimla Devi, (PW-2) residing there, of the incident. The prosecutrix stayed overnight in the house of PW-2. PW-2 told the whole incident to her husband (PW-3). In the morning PW-3 called villagers; the statement of prosecutrix was recorded by one of the villagers viz., Roop Singh (PW-4). The FIR was then registered at the Ghumarwin Police Station. The prosecutrix and the accused were got medically examined. The Investigating Officer took the apparel of the prosecutrix in his possession and the same was sent for chemical analysis alongwith vaginal slide and underwear of the accused. During the investigation, it also transpired that the prosecutrix belonged to Scheduled Caste. After completion of the investigation, a charge-sheet was filed against the accused under Sections 366 and 376 IPC and Section 3(XII) of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989. 3), Roop Singh (PW-4), Smt.

However, at the same time, it has modified the sentence by reducing it to rigorous imprisonment for a period of 4 years instead of 7 years for the offence punishable under Section 376 of the IPC. With this solitary modification resulting into partial allowing of the appeal, rest of the judgment and sentence dated 15.09.2005 passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Sabarkantha, 4th Fast Track Court, Modasa, Gujarat has been affirmed. On 01.09.2003 at about 17.15 hours when wife of the complainant returned from the market purchasing vegetable, she could not find her daughter at home. On inquiring from one Hansaben, she came to know that the knowledge that the appellant had come to their house and had a talk with their daughter. Thereafter, the appellant went towards the market and after sometime, prosecutrix also went towards the market. The complainant inquired from the shop of the uncle of the appellant and he was told that the appellant and the prosecutrix had gone towards Modasa Bus Stand. The complaint rushed to the Modasa Bus Stand, but could not find the appellant or the prosecutrix there. It is also the case of the prosecution that son of the uncle of the appellant told that he had seen the appellant and the prosecutrix - Anita at the Modasa Bus Stand some time ago. Since the prosecutrix could not be traced, a complaint to the said effect was registered by the complainant on 05.09.2003 with Meghraj Police Station. Two days after the said complaint, the appellant surrendered himself before the Police on 07.09.2003. Thereafter, necessary panchnama came to be drawn and statements of the appellant and prosecutrix were recorded. They were also sent for medical examination. Clothes of the appellant and prosecutrix were seized in the presence of panchas and were sent for analysis to FSL, Ahmedabad. The investigation revealed sufficient evidence against the appellant. This led to his formal arrest on 30.11.2003. Thereafter, as the case was exclusively triable by the Court of Sessions, the case was committed to Sessions Court, Himmatnagar. 5) After framing of the charge, the trial proceeded. The prosecution examined as many as 11 witnesses to prove the charges. The particulars of these witnesses are as under: 9) The questions formulated at Serial Nos.1 to 4 above were decided in the affirmative. The discussion in the judgment reveals that it was an admitted case that the victim and the accused were from the same community and they both had gone out of station together. It was also established on record that there was physical relationship between them at different places and at different times and marriage was also performed on 09.03.2003 at Unza which was duly registered in the Office of Marriage Registrar. However, the primary defence of the appellant was that the prosecutrix was major; she accompanied the appellant willingly and entered into physical relationship as well as matrimonial alliance out of her free will, desire and consent.
