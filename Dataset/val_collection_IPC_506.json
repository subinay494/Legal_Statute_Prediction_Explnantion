It is stated that the accused had 2 brothers and 2 sisters out of which Saraswathi also known as Sarasu, the elder sister, was doing the work of agricultural labourer. About 15 years prior to the incident in question, one of the sons of deceased D-1, namely, Muthusamy and another friend of his also known as Muthusamy @ Kidakarar son of Chinnappa Gounder had raped the said Sarasu. In regard to this incident, a Panchayat was called and there was a suggestion that either of the persons involved in the said rape incident should marry the said Sarasu which was not agreed to by D-1 and the latter had threatened the family of the appellant to banish the said Sarasu from the village because of her bad character. The appellant's family being helpless, had to send her away to Madras where she lived for sometime and about 4 years before the date of the incident, she had come back to the village along with another person whom she claimed to have married and on coming to know of the said incident of rape, her husband is supposed to have taken her away to a place called Karaikudi. The further case of the prosecution is that thereafter about 2 years prior to the date of the incident, the said Saraswati again came back to the village alone and when D-1 came to know of the same, he called the appellant and warned him that if Sarasu has allowed to stay in the village, he would arrange for a boycott of the family by other villagers, therefore, he directed the appellant to take Sarasu away from the village because of which Sarasu had to go away. It is the case of the prosecution that since then the appellant entertained a grudge against D-1 and was off and on telling people that because of the deceased persons, his family had been ruined. With this incident in the background, according to the prosecution, the appellant wanted to take vengeance upon the deceased persons, hence, on 1990 at about 30 p.m. when the two deceased persons were working on a piece of land near about their house, he attacked them with a sickle, consequent upon which both the deceased died on the spot. According to this witness, when he went near the place of the incident, he saw the accused first cut his father's head at the back of his neck forcibly with a sickle. Though he shouted at the appellant not to cut, the appellant proceeded to inflict 2 cuts on D-2 on the back side of his neck. At the same time he threatened this witness not to go near him or else he would cut him also.", "statute": ["s7", "s3"]}, "2009.INSC.737.txt": {"doc_url": "http://www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/2009/737.html", "explanation": {"They scolded him on account of the calf entering their thrashing floor.
