At about 00 or 30 p.m. they came back from there by a bus and were sitting in their Khallihan underneath a neem tree. Gajraj (PW.4), Gulab Rani (PW.2) (wife of Umrao) and Kirat (PW.5) were also present in the vicinity. PW.5 thereafter had taken his cattle to the village pond. PW.2 and her son-PW.4 went to drink water in the hutment of one Gore Lal. When she was drinking water, Umrao's daughter-Phulbai came there and informed her mother-PW.2 that a large number of persons had assembled in the baithaka (an assembly hall) of one Modley, were holding guns, lathis, axes and ballams etc. and saying that \"Umrao and Juggey had come, let us kill them\". Hearing this, PW.4 and PW.2 came out of the hut and saw the accused persons coming towards them from three sides. Ratan, resident of village Ratanpur, was standing on the road leading to the school, Ratan Modley stood on the road leading to Chittar, both holding guns, and blocked the passage. Ratan Modley was exhorting other accused. In all, forty four accused persons came there, out of whom, appellants Nathu, Meharban, Bhagirath, Girdhari and accused Gopi, Bahadur and Babu, in all seven, were armed with axes, appellant Dayaram and accused Darbari and Vijay with ballams, accused Ratan, resident of village Ratanpur, and Ratan Modley with guns and other thirty two accused including the other appellants with lathis. All of them started assaulting Umrao and Juggey with axes, lathis and ballams underneath the neem tree. When PW.2, PW.4 and Gore Lal tried to save them, they were also assaulted by some of the accused persons. PW.4 was assaulted by accused Sukh Singh, Jawahar, Ratan, resident of Madawara, and appellants Uttam and Girdhari with lathis. PW.2 was assaulted by appellant Uttam and accused Bahadur with lathi and axe respectively. In the midst of assault, Umrao somehow managed to escape towards the village. He was chased and thrown on the ground by appellants Meharban, Bhagirath, Dhan Prasad and Sura besides accused Gopi and Ganiya and assaulted by them with axes and lathis. In the course of the assault, witnesses Mulchandra, Nathu, Panchey, Lakshman, Rammu and Khuman came to the place of occurrence and intervened. Lakshaman asked the assailants, \"you had already finished two persons, will you kill the whole family\", whereupon the assailants ran towards the village. While running away accused Bahadur turned back and struck a blow of axe on the head of Juggey and thereafter they fled away. During the occurrence, two persons, namely, Umrao and Juggey lost their lives and two members of their family viz. , PW.2 and PW.4 besides one Gore Lal sustained injuries. Stating these facts, First Information Report of this incident was lodged by PW.5 at Police Station Madawara at 35 p.m. in which forty four accused persons, including the appellants, were named. The police after registering the case took up investigation and on completion thereof submitted charge sheet, on receipt whereof, the learned Magistrate took cognizance and committed the aforesaid forty four accused persons, including the appellants, to the Court of Sessions to face trial. The occurrence is said to have taken place at about 30 p.m. and the First Information Report was lodged very promptly at the police station at 35 p.m. , i.e. , only after an hour of the occurrence, although distance of the police station from the place of occurrence was four kilometers. In the present case, place of occurrence cannot be doubted as the Investigating Officer had recovered blood stained earth therefrom. Nothing could be pointed out to show that the occurrence had taken place at some other place. Five persons had received injuries, out of whom, two had succumbed to the same. From amongst the two deceased, Umrao had received 17 injures, out of which some of the injuries were incised wounds. All the injuries by sharp edged weapon were on the forehead, right, left and on the back of the head behind midline right ear. Apart from these injuries by sharp edged weapon, he had also sustained two injuries by hard and blunt weapon on the head. The other two incised wounds were on his legs and the same were bone deep. Rest of the injuries on the person of the victim were abrasions on thigh, knee, legs and on the back of outer and inner left leg. The number of abrasions upon the person of deceased Umrao further go a long way to corroborate the prosecution case that when during the course of assault, he wanted to run towards the village, he was thrown down on the ground and assaulted by the appellants in front of beda of Gulzari and killed by lathis and axes. An examination of incised wounds clearly reveals that this deceased had sustained one incised wound 1\" x \" x bone deep on the left side of midline of the forehead and the second incised wound on the head at the right ear region. The direction is the same. The third incised wound is also on right side of the forehead direction from behind forward. The two lacerated wounds are on right side of the head. Another deceased Juggey had sustained as many as eight injuries. Out of them injury Nos. 1,2,6,7 and 8 were incised wounds varying in dimension. Injury no.1 was in the size of 1-5/8 x1\" bone deep on the left forehead, above outer end of left eye brow underlying bone fractured. Injury no.2 was of the dimension of 2\" x 1/6\" x bone deep on the right side of head 4\" behind right ear. Injury no. 6 was punctured wound in the size of 3/8\" x 1/8\" x \" on the back and inner side of left wrist. Injury no. 7 was also another incised wound 5/8\" x 1/6\" x muscle deep outer side of left leg. In the opinion of the doctor, injury Nos. 6, 7 and 8 were caused with ballam whereas injury Nos. 1 and 2 axes. Underneath injury no.1 comminuted fracture was found. The Doctor stated in his cross-examination that out of injuries sustained by deceased- Juggey, six were on the left side. He further stated that all the incised wounds sustained by Juggey were going upwards and two punctured wounds of Juggey were on the non-vital parts. Apart from the two deceased persons, three other persons, namely, Gulab Rani (PW 2), Gajraj (PW 4) and Gore Lal had also received injuries and out of them injured PW.2 had received four injuries, some on vital parts like head and others on left scapular region and right arm. One of the injuries was caused by sharp edged weapon and others by hard and blunt weapon. The other injured PW.4 received as many as 18 injuries on different parts of his body. The third injured Gore Lal is said to have received one injury on the chest. These three injured were examined by Dr. O.P.Chaddha (PW 1) in whose evidence, there is nothing to suggest that the injuries would have been self inflicted inasmuch as otherwise also in view of the nature of injuries especially when the same are on vital parts of the body as well, the factum that these persons had received injuries cannot be doubted. If the evidence of this witness is read in its entirety, it becomes clear that according to her evidence, the accused persons inflicted injuries not only upon the two deceased persons but also upon the three injured. The total number of accused persons was forty four and the number of injuries found on the two deceased and three injured were forty eight which go to show that the medical evidence fits in with the prosecution case disclosed in the First Information Report as well as evidence of the witnesses. Moreover, the three injured persons had received injuries, namely, Gulab Rani (PW 2), Gajraj (PW 4) and one Gore Lal and number of injuries found by the doctor upon their persons are in all These persons had received multiple injuries by sharp edged and lethal weapons and on vital parts of the body as well. Neither from the evidence of doctor, it appears that their injuries could be self inflicted nor there is any other circumstance to draw such an inference. The inflicting of injuries upon these three persons fits in with the time of occurrence disclosed in the First Information Report as well as the evidence and the same do not fit in with the hypothesis that occurrence might have taken place in the dead of night, especially when there is no circumstance whatsoever warranting such an inference. It appears that the occurrence had taken place under a neem tree where accused persons came from the baithaka of Modley. The fact that the accused persons had collected in the baithaka of one Modley and were planning there to murder the two deceased persons having not been proved by non- examination of Phulbai, the same cannot in any way affect the manner of occurrence under the neem tree where the accused persons are said to have arrived and assaulted the two deceased persons and the three injured persons inflicting as many as 48 injuries in all.", "statute": ["s1"]}, "2011.INSC.780.txt": {"doc_url": "http://www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/2011/780.html", "explanation": {"It was stated by Himmat Raj Singh (since deceased) that at 9.30 a.m., when he was standing outside his house, Arjun Singh fired at him from a muzzle loaded gun from the roof of Karan Singh thereby 2-3 bullets hit him on the left hand and another 2-3 hit his abdomen and left thigh.": ["s3"], "On hearing his cries, two of his brothers, namely, Raghuraj Singh (since deceased) and Raj Singh (PW-2) came there and 2 took him inside the house and after leaving him there, when they were going to inform the police at Police out-post, Anwa, Bheem Singh and Gajender Singh (who are now absconding), Banney Singh, Karan Singh and Shivraj Singh fired gunshots at them, as a result of which, both of them received injuries.": ["s1", "s3"], "Accused- Arjun Singh fired at Himmat Raj Singh (since deceased) from the roof of Karan Singh from a capped gun thereby few bullets hit the deceased on the left hand and another 2-3 hit his abdomen and left thigh.": ["s1", "s3"], "On hearing his cries, brothers of the deceased, Raghuraj Singh and Raj Singh (PW-2) came there and took injured Himmat Raj Singh inside their house and after leaving him there, when both of them were going to police out-post to lodge a complaint, at that time, Bheem Singh, Gajendra Singh, Banney Singh, Karan Singh and Shivraj Singh fired on them resulting in the death of Raghuraj Singh.": ["s1", "s3"], "Thereafter, accused Bahadur Singh came with a gandassa.": ["s1"], "The other accused, Laxman Raigar also jumped into their house.": ["s1"], "It was also stated that Smt.

The incident occurred at about 30 p.m. on 1984 in a village known as Kantharia within the jurisdiction of Jharda Police Station. It was alleged that when Shivnath Singh (PW-13) was sitting in his house along with Ram Pratap Singh (PW-18), Prem Singh (deceased) and Bhom Singh (PW-19), accused persons Mohan Singh, Manohar Singh, Kripal Singh (A-12), Laxman Singh and Karan Singh (A-9) were 3 also sitting nearby, abuses were exchanged between both the parties. Jaswant Singh (PW-12) asked members of both the parties not to hurl abuses to each other. Kripal Singh (A-16), Bhupendra Singh @ Bhopal Singh (A-17) and Kuber Singh armed with 12 bore guns at that time came from the old village of Kanthariya on a tractor. The said tractor was driven by Bhanwar Singh (A-6). Laxman Singh is said to have been armed with dhariya, Manohar Singh was having spear and stone and other accused were said to have been armed with lathis. When Jaswant Singh asked the accused persons not to quarrel, Manohar Singh pelted stone causing injury on his head, whereupon he fell down on the ground. Thereafter, Shyam Singh and Kripal Singh (A-12) caused injuries to him by a dhariya. Other accused persons are also said to have assaulted by lathis. Bhupendra Singh (A-17) is said to have fired a gun shot to the chest of Prem Singh and Kripal Singh (A-16) as well as Kuber Singh are also said to have fired shots at Bhom Singh, Meharban Singh (PW-22) and Babu Lal (PW-23). During the incident Hakam Singh (PW-17), Ram Pratap Singh, Rajendra Singh (PW-20), Bhupendra Singh (PW-21), Meharban Singh and Bharat Singh (PW-24) are said to have suffered injuries. 4 Shivnath Singh, who examined himself as PW-13, lodged the First Information Report in relation to the said incident at about 45 p.m. on the same day. The post-mortem examination on the body of the deceased Prem Singh was conducted by Dr. Murlidhar Varun (PW-2). He also examined the other injured witnesses. Another doctor, viz. Dr. Sunil Jamindar (PW-1), a Radiologist, also examined some injured witnesses. The prosecution in support of its case examined 27 witnesses. Three of the witnesses, namely, Babu Khan, Meharban Singh and Babu Lal have been declared hostile. Jaswant Singh, Ram Pratap Singh, Bhom Singh, Rajendra Singh and Bharat Singh are injured witnesses. Shivnath Singh is the first informant. He also sustained injuries. Apart from the aforementioned injured witnesses, Hakam Singh, who is the brother of 11 the deceased is said to be an eye-witnesections Vikram Singh (PW-16) reached the place of occurrence immediately after the incident. Bhupendra Singh (PW-21) is also said to be an eye-witnesections Other important witnesses who have been examined by the prosecution are Dr. Three of the accused persons are also said to have suffered some injuries viz. Manohar Singh, Mohan Singh and Laxman Singh. 18. The fact that there are two groups in the village, one belonging to Bhupendra Singh and the other Jaswant Singh is not in dispute. Bhupendra Singh (A-17) contested the Panchayat elections against Vikram Singh, wherein the latter lost. 19. Allegedly, owing to political and group rivalry, the complainant party drove their cattle inside the field of Laxman Singh. A First Information Report was lodged by him 8 or 9 days prior to the day of incident against Chhotey Singh and Vikram Singh for causing damage to his crops. Laxman Singh also lodged first information report against Bhom Singh and Kalu Singh for having been assaulted by them. 20. In the First Information Report, it was alleged that on 1984 at about 30 p.m. at village new Kanthariya persons from both the parties had assembled. There was exchange of abuses. Jaswant Singh had requested Ram Pratap Singh, Prem Singh and Bhom Singh and accused persons, namely, Mohan Singh, Manohar Singh, Kripal Singh (A-12), Laxman Singh and Karan Singh, not to hurl abuses to each other. He intended to pacify them. Kripal Singh (A-16), Bhupendra Singh @ 13 Bhopal Singh and Kuber Singh armed with 12 bore guns came on a tractor, which was being driven by Bhanwar Singh. It is not in dispute that Laxman Singh was armed with Dhariya, whereas Manohar Singh was armed with spear and stone and the other accused persons were armed with lathis. As soon as Jaswant Singh asked them not to quarrel, a stone was pelted at him by Manohar Singh, which caused an injury on his head. He fell down on the ground. Thereafter, accused Shyam Singh and Kripal Singh (A-12) caused injuries to him by dhariya. Bhupendra Singh (A-17) fired a shot at the chest of Prem Singh (deceased). Kripal Singh (A-16) and Kuber Singh had also shot fires at Bhom Singh, Meharban Singh and Babu Lal. Other prosecution witnesses, as noticed hereinbefore, were also injured. The First Information Report was lodged at about 45 p.m. Vikram Singh is a witness who had come to the scene of occurrence, a little later. From his evidence, however, it is clear that Shivnath Singh was present at the spot and he had taken the deceased Prem Singh and other victims to the police station. According to the said witness, when he was sitting with his elder brother deceased Prem Singh, Shivnath Singh, Ram Pratap Singh, Bhom Singh son of Shambhoo Singh near the house of Shivnath Singh, accused Mohan Singh, Manohar Singh, Kripal Singh (A-12) started hurling abuses. Jaswant Singh tried to intervene, whereupon a stone was thrown by accused Manohar Singh, which hit his head. The tractor carrying Kuber Singh and Kripal Singh (A-16) came at the place of occurrence at that point of time. Admittedly, they were armed with guns. Hakam Singh in his evidence accepted that on abuses being hurled by the accused persons, Shivnath Singh had also hurled abuses. They thereafter reached the corner of the house of Mod 17 Singh, where Manohar Singh had hit Jaswant Singh. Parties had entered into a scuffle with each other, whereafter only the tractor carrying Kuber Singh, Kripal Singh (A-16) and Bhanwar Singh reached. According to him, abuses continued to be exchanged between both the parties for about 4-5 minutes. He also accepted that Shivnath Singh was armed with a lathi and Ram Pratap Singh was having a dhariya, Bhom Singh son of Shambhoo Singh was armed with a lathi, Prem Singh was also having a lathi with him. In his examination-in-chief, he stated that Bhom Singh had hit Kuber Singh with a sword, at that time Kuber Singh had come down from the tractor and he had withstood the attack with the sword on the barrel of his gun. At this stage, we may also notice the statement of Bhom Singh, who examined himself as PW- According to this witness when both the sides had been hurling abuses against each other, Jaswant Singh, knowing both the parties, went to make them see reason, and at that point of time, he was attacked. He also rushed there. He was hit by a gun shot injury. He became unconscious. According to him he had also been assaulted by dhariya on his face below the eye. This witness also accepted that Shivnath Singh and Ram Pratap Singh were holding lathis. It is, however, not in dispute that Jaswant Singh, father of the witness, was empty handed. Both the learned Trial Judge also the High Court placed implicit reliance on his evidence. Rajendra Singh, Bhupinder Singh (PW-21) and Bharat Singh in their respective depositions asserted that Bhupendra Singh, Kuber Singh and Kripal Singh had been armed with guns and they fired from their respective guns causing injuries upon Prem Singh. A suggestion made by the defence to these witnesses that they had caused injuries to the 20 accused persons had not been denied. The suggestion to these witnesses that there had been free fight between the parties was also denied. The fact that the parties belonged to two different factions of the village is not in dispute. The incident in question is also not in dispute. Participation of the accused persons except Bhupendra Singh (A- 17) is also not in dispute. The fact that both the parties hurled abuses against each other is again not of much dispute. We may, however, notice that the prosecution witnesses were sitting; only a few of them might have lathis in their hands which are usually carried by the villagers. However, from the evidence brought on records, it is apparent that it is the accused persons who had started abusing the other party. Why they did so or whether they had any reason therefor is not a matter, which would be decisive. There cannot be any doubt whatsoever that Jaswant Singh as also Shivnath Singh, Vikram Singh, Bhom Singh (PW- 19), Rajendra Singh, Meharban Singh, Babu Lal, and Bharat Singh asserted in their respective depositions that Jaswant Singh intended to pacify them. Although Bhom Singh (PW-19) might have stated that parties started quarrelling with each other after arrival of his father, but the fact that his father Jaswant Singh tried to pacify both the groups cannot be disbelieved. The fact that he had received an injury on his forehead caused by throwing of a stone is also not in dispute. Sufferance of multiple injuries on his person cannot also be in dispute. Except possession of lathis by three prosecution witnesses, other prosecution witnesses did not have any other weapon. In fact, one of the witnesses could snatch a gun from the hands of Bhupendra Singh (A-17). 35. Jaswant Singh and Bhom Singh (father and son) do not appear to be belonging to any group. They merely took a lead to pacify both the groups. It is only when Jaswant Singh was injured and accused persons started assaulting him and some others, Bhom Singh (PW-19) caused an injury to Kuber Singh. Kuber Singh could have exercised his right of private defence; but he not only fired a shot at Bhom Singh (PW-19), he fired shots which had hit Prem Singh and three shots which had hit Hakam Singh in his stomach, legs and hands. It is not correct that Bhom Singh (PW-19) had caused injuries to any other person. Kuber Singh evidently used more force than needed. Mohan Singh was armed with a gun. Apart from Mohar Singh, other persons were also armed with guns, namely, Kripal Singh (A-16), Bhupendra Singh (A-17) and Kuber Singh. It may be true that Hakam Singh had not taken the name of Bhupendra Singh (A-17), but all other witnesses, namely, Jaswant Singh, Shivnath Singh, Ram Pratap Singh, Rajendra Singh and Bhupendra Singh (PW-21) categorically stated that he had also fired at Prem Singh. His name also was mentioned in the First Information Report. All of them had fired at Prem Singh. Prem Singh admittedly had suffered a large number of injuries. Such injuries caused to him were likely to cause his death. Applying this to the facts of the instant case, we may analyse the materials on record : i) It is not in dispute that among the accused present at the scene of the occurrence prior to the arrival of the tractor [namely Mohan Singh (A-4), Manohar Singh (A-2), Kirpal Singh (A-12), Laxman Singh (A-3) and Karan Singh (A-9)], Laxman Singh (A-3) was armed with a `dhariya', while Manohar Singh (A-2) was armed with a spear and a stone. ii) Kripal Singh (A-16), Bhupendra Singh (A-17) and Kuber Singh (A-18), arrived at the scene of the crime armed with 12 bore guns on a tractor driven by Bhanwar Singh (A-6). iii) Apart from the specific weapons mentioned above, the other accused were armed with `lathis'. iv) Therefore, given the nature of the weapons, it is clear that all of the accused were, at the very least, armed with weapons capable of causing grievous hurt. The presence of weapons such as 12 bore 27 guns and spears leads to the inference that that the accused persons were prepared to cause death. v) Moreover, the arrival of three of the accused on a tractor with guns shows that there was some sort of prior concert, at least among those three accused, prior to arriving at the scene of the crime regarding preparedness to cause death in the eventuality of an armed assault. vi) The incident was precipitated by the aggressive act of Manohar Singh pelting Jaswant Singh, who was trying to pacify both groups, with a stone. vii) Following this, only when Jaswant Singh was injured and the accused persons started assaulting him and some others, Bhom Singh (PW-19) caused an injury to Kuber Singh (A-18), who then proceeded to fire shots at Bhom Singh, and also shot Prem Singh (the deceased) and Hakam Singh. viii) Mohan Singh, Kripal Singh and Bhupendra Singh were also armed with guns and, on appreciation of the evidence, all of them had 28 fired at Prem Singh, causing injuries to Prem Singh which were likely to cause death. x) Here, the unlawful assembly came together, heavily armed, with the common object of causing at the very least grievous hurt to their adversaries in the course of an armed assault which could lead to more serious injuries. Given the circumstances in which this assembly came together and given that all parties were aware that among them, certain members carried weapons like guns and spears, even if it is held that the common object of the assembly was not to cause death, it would not be an unreasonable inference that all the accused knew that the offence of culpable homicide was likely to be committed in prosecution of such an armed assault on another group which was not prepared to withstand such an attack, bringing about the application of the second portion of Section 29 xi) Therefore, any of the accused found to have participated in the assault should be held guilty. The prosecution witnesses had clearly stated that Shyam Singh and Kripal Singh (A-16) had attacked Jaswant Singh. He sustained dhariya blows on his head. According to Bhom Singh (PW-19), Mohan Singh had fired at him, whereupon he became unconscious. The present case would fall into the latter category as facts clearly establish a common object to orchestrate an armed attack of such a serious nature that, even if the common object itself was not to cause death, the accused can be said to have been possessed of the knowledge that the offence of murder/culpable homicide would be committed in prosecution of this common object, and such a common object is irreconcilable with the right to private defence. Bhupendra Singh took a leading role. He was named in the First Information Report which was recorded immediately. According to Jaswant Singh (PW-12), Shiv Nath Singh (PW-13), Ram Pratap Singh (PW-18) and Bhupinder Singh (PW-21), he not only was having a 12 48 bore double barrel gun but he had also fired a shot on Prem Singh. He was also seen with a gun by Rajendra Singh (PW-20). It would be a matter of minutes or a fraction thereof, if the accused had at once left the place by the other door, the moment he heard the alarm of PW- The PW-7 though a neighbour lives in different house and by the time he reached, it is not unlikely that he may have missed the appellant who had left the spot. Therefore, on the basis of the mere statement of PW-7 that on his arrival he found no one else it can not be said that PW-3 told a lie while stating that her husband had slipped away from the other door on hearing her cries. At the same time, we also find no good reason to suspect that she would falsely implicate her husband for 49 the killing of their sons by some one else. The real assailants of her own children would not be spared. Similarly, participation of Kripal Singh and Kuber Singh is also beyond any doubt. He came in the tractor having a gun. Kuber also came with a gun and fire a shot at Bhom Singh, Meharban Singh (PW-22) and Babu Lal (PW-23). The statement made in the First Information Report has been supported by Shiv Nath Singh (PW-13), Hakam Singh (PW-17), Ram Pratap Singh (PW-18), Bhupinder Singh (PW-21) as also Bharat Singh (PW-24).", "statute": ["s1"]}, "2013.INSC.505.txt": {"doc_url": "http://www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/2013/505.html", "explanation": {"The prosecution version is that on 5.7.1983 at about 5 AM to 5.30 AM, some 200-250 villagers, which included the accused persons as well, armed with various weapons like Lathi, Ladna, Farsa, Hasua and Ballam surrounded the village Siktahar.": ["s1"], "The accused persons forced out a number of persons from their houses, assaulted them in various ways and ultimately took four of them in tie-bound condition to a place called Hijul Pakur Field which is some distance away from village Siktahar and they assaulted them with various weapons causing serious injuries.": ["s3", "s1"], "During the course of occurrence, accused persons also assaulted Mohammed Badaruddin PW3, Mohamed Sabiruddin PW5 and Mohammed Kalimuddin PW6.": ["s1"], "One of the injured, namely Azad Ali, succumbed to his injuries.": ["s3"]}, "fact": " ##  MD.ISHAQUE & ORS. v.

Kallu dealt a blow on the head of Sadruddin with a sword. Madaniya also dealt a blow with a sword on his hand. Shafi gave a blow of sword injuring his forehead, nose and jaw. Bhuria gave a blow with a spear injuring his thigh and calf. On seeing Sadruddin being attacked, Sabdar Bano (PW-6), Noorbano (PW-7), Baby (PW-9) and Annobai (PW-10) rushed to the rescue of Sadruddin. They were also beaten up by the appellants and their associates. Sabdarbano received injuries on her head and body. Annobai received injuries on the head. Baby and Noorbano received injuries on their hands. By then, a Police van came near the spot. On seeing it, the appellants and others took to their heels. Kanizbano (PW-3) who was sitting outside her house and who witnessed the entire incident, along with some others, took the injured persons to the hospital.  Kanizbano also lodged an FIR (Ex. P-28) within half an hour of the incident in Police Station, Dhar, naming all the 27 persons. The first is that all the eye- witnesses belonged to Sadruddin group who had enmity with the accused and, therefore, their statements were not reliable. The second is that no independent eye-witness was examined even though some spectators were stated to be present. The third is that there were inconsistencies in the statements of the eye- witnesses. Kanizbano, PW-3, who does not belong to the family of the injured Sadruddin and lives near the house of Sadruddin has stated that Kallu, Safi, Madaniya, (appellant Nos.1, 2 and 3) had beaten Sadruddin. She has also stated that they along with others, including Bhuria, (appellant no.4), had come armed with dharias, farsas, lathis etc. , shouting \"kill, kill\". 10. Sadruddin (PW-4) has named all the four appellants and 18 other accused as the persons who came armed with swords, ballams, hockey sticks, farsas and dharias. He also described the manner in which each of the appellants had inflicted blows on him. vHe stated that Kallu hit him on his head with a sword; that Madaniya hit him with a sword on his hand; that Shafi hit him with a sword on his face injuring his forehead, eye and nose and breaking his tooth; and that Bhuria gave a blow with Ballam causing injuries to his thigh and calf. 11. PW-6, Sabdarbano, daughter of Sadruddin, specifically stated that appellant nos. 1 to 4 and their friends (who were present in court) had come armed with spears, dariyas, lathis etc. , and that they were shouting \"Maro, kato\". She also stated that Kallu hit her father with a sword; that Shafi had a sword and Bhuria had a spear. She stated that when she along with PW-7 and PW-10 went to rescue her father, they attacked her and she received sword hits on her hand and ribs and spear hit on her shoulder and head and that her fingers were fractured. Noorbano, PW-7, another daughter of Sadruddin stated that appellant Nos.1 to 4 and other accused had come running and Kallu hit her father on the head using a sword. She also stated that when she, PW-6, PW-9 and PW-10 went to rescue her father, they were all beaten up by all the accused and that her hand was injured. Baby (whose father is a nephew of Sadruddin) examined as PW-9, stated that appellants 1 to 4 chased Sadruddin; that Kallu hit him with a sword on the head and Shafi hit him on the face with a sword, and that all of them beat Sadruddin. She also stated that she was hit by someone on right hand. Annobai (PW-10), niece of Sadruddin stated that Kallu and others came to the house of Sadruddin, shouting \"kill/cut\" and Kallu, Bhuria and Altaf hit Sadruddin with sword/s. She also states that she was hit by a sword on her head by someone. It is true that only Sadruddin clearly stated as to who hit him with what weapon and at which part of his body. The other four eye-witnesses (PWs 6, 7, 9 and 10) have not stated who landed the blows on them. All of them, however, identify Kallu as hitting Sadruddin on the head. In addition, Baby (PW-9) has stated that Shafi hit Sadruddin on the nose and Annobai (PW-10), stated that Bhuria hit Sadruddin with a sword. 13.  ; that a blow was given when Sadruddin was sitting on Otla of his house and, thereafter, he ran a few steps and there all the appellants landed him blows with different weapons. It is also clear that when the womenfolk, namely, PWs.6, 7, 9 and 10 ran to save him, they were also beaten up. The evidence also clearly shows that neither Sadruddin nor the womenfolk were armed. On the other hand, appellants 1 to 4 were armed when they came in a group along with others to Sadruddin's house shouting \"kill/hit\". The evidence of the eye-witnesses is also clear that but for a Police van intervening at that time, there was the likelihood of Sadruddin and the women who went to save him, sustaining more injuries. Though there was a cross-complaint by the defence group, significantly, none of the appellants was injured. The evidence also shows that there was a longstanding enmity between Sadruddin and Kallu. The contention that when only four persons are found guilty, there cannot be conviction under section 149 Indian Penal Code, 1860, has no merit. Section 149 provides that if an offence is committed by any member of an unlawful assembly in prosecution of the common object of that assembly, or such as the members of that assembly knew to be likely to be committed in prosecution of that object, every person who, at the time of the committing of that offence, is a member of the same assembly, is guilty of that offence. Section 141 requires a minimum of five persons for being designated as an 'unlawful assembly'. 18. PW- 4 specifically named 22 persons and further named the four out of them who landed him the blows. PW-3 names 12 persons who came as a group. Other eye-witnesses also clearly stated that the appellants with other accused who were present in court had come to attack Sadruddin.", "statute": ["s1"]}, "1997.INSC.777.txt": {"doc_url": "http://www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/1997/777.html", "explanation": {"This appeal is preferred under section 379 of the code of Criminal Procedure in connection with a double murder which took place at about 00 a.m. on Seven accused, namely, Sirajul Haq, Abdulas, Anwar Ali, Zainul Abdin, Yunus, Haroon and Baitullah, were charged under Section 147, 148, 302 read with Section 149, Indian Penal Code, 1860.": ["s1"], "When all the accused were concealing their presence behind a Masjid, which was on the eastern side of the house of Sirajul Haq accused.": ["s1"], "On this, the deceased raised alarms and ran towards the north of the Masjid, At that time PWs.2,3 and 4, who were sitting at the door of one Abdul Rashid, ran towards them.": ["s1"], "In the meantime, A-2 dealt a spear blow n the chest of Nizar Ahmad.": ["s1"], "On account of that he fell down in the field of Mujibullah and died instantaneously.": ["s1"], "Accused 5 to 7 surrounded Nabi Rasool and caused spear injuries to him.": ["s1"], "Nabi Rasool ran with the injuries on his body and fell down in the room of one mohd.": ["s1"], "It is an admitted fact that Abdulas (A-2) caused spear blow in the vital part of Nisar Ahmad, which resulted in his instantaneous death.": ["s1"], "The nature of the injury caused by the weapon used on the vital part of the body, be it noted against an unarmed person negates any just plea for right to self defence.": ["s1"], "Coming to accused no.7 (Baitullah), we find from the records that he has admitted that he wielded the spear but, according to him, in self-defence.": ["s1"], "As pointed out by the High Court, the question of self-defence in this case may not arise when the deceased as well as PWs.2 to 4 who were near the scene of occurrence, were totally unarmed.": ["s1"], "It is an admitted fact that the complainant and the appellants were on inimical terms and some criminal proceedings were pending between them even at the time when the occurrence took place.": ["s1"], "It is equally true that Bahori.": ["s1"], "PW 1 is be brother of the deceased and informant Sat Pal Singh, PW 7 is the son of the deceased.": ["s1"], "But we are not convinced by the aforesaid arguments that either on account of animosity or on account of relationship they did not divulge the truth but fabricated a false case against the appellants.": ["s1"]}, "fact": " This appeal is preferred under section 379 of the code of Criminal Procedure in connection with a double murder which took place at about 00 a.m. on Seven accused, namely, Sirajul Haq, Abdulas, Anwar Ali, Zainul Abdin, Yunus, Haroon and Baitullah, were charged under Section 147, 148, 302 read with Section 149, Indian Penal Code, 1860. The case of the prosecution as culled out from the paper book is as follows:- On the fateful day the deceased Nabi Rasool. brother of informant in the case and another deceased Nisar Ahmed, cousin of the informant, were going from east to west in Chhithi village within Mahuli Police Station, Pasti, District. When all the accused were concealing their presence behind a Masjid, which was on the eastern side of the house of Sirajul Haq accused.

PW.6, a Sub-inspector, reached the place of occurrence at 45 a.m. and prepared an Inquest Report and the dead body of Nisar Ahmad was sent to the mortuary. PW.1 the Doctor who conducted the post-mortem of the deceased Nizar Ahmad, found the following ante-mortem injury: \"Punctured wound 3 cms. x 5 cms. x chest cavity deep over left side of chest 2 cms medial to left nipple, placed vertically, directed oblique medially and backward. The margins of wound are quite sharp and gaping. The injury is situated by the side of sternal bone cutting 4th and 5th (ribs. ) cartilages vertically and thoroughly. Internal examination revealed cutting of 4th and 5th cartilages under the injury. The surface of chest-wall was congested under the injury 5 litres of blood was found in the chest cavity. Pericardial sec. was punctured 3 cm x 1 cm. x 6 cm. Rest of the internal organs were normal. The Doctor was of the opinion that the death of Nisar Ahmad was due to shock and haemorrhage as a result of ante- mortem injury. One Dr. Avinash Chandra examined the injuries inflicted on by Nabi Rasool and found the following injuries on the body of nabi Rasool when he was brought to the Hospital:- \"(1) Punctured wound 4 cms. x 2 cms. x plural cavity deep right side front of chest vertically placed 14 cms. away from right nipple. Bleeding present kept under observation, Margins sharp. (2) Abrasion 1 cm. x 1 cm. on right thumb. (3) Incised wound 1 cm. x 2 cm. x muscle deep on left thumb, stern aspect. According to the Doctor, Injury Nos.1 and 3 were caused by sharp-edged point weapon and they were fresh at the time of examination. After the death of Nabi Rasool, PW.1 conducted the post-mortem of deceased Nabi Rasool and he gave his report as follows:- \" Stitched wound 5 cms. long with 4 stitches. After removal of stitches, the margins are sharp. The wound is stitched over right side of chest in posterior axillary line 5 cms. below axillary.

Incised wound 6 cm. x 2 cm. x skin deep over dorsum and middle of right index finger. Internal examination revealed that the right liver and lung were punctured under Injury no.1 In the opinion of the Doctor, death was due to shock and haemorrhage as a result of ante-mortem injury no. \" All the accused pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. It is an admitted fact that Abdulas (A-2) caused spear blow in the vital part of Nisar Ahmad, which resulted in his instantaneous death. The nature of the injury caused by the weapon used on the vital part of the body, be it noted against an unarmed person negates any just plea for right to self defence. Coming to accused no.7 (Baitullah), we find from the records that he has admitted that he wielded the spear but, according to him, in self-defence. As pointed out by the High Court, the question of self-defence in this case may not arise when the deceased as well as PWs.2 to 4 who were near the scene of occurrence, were totally unarmed. It is an admitted fact that the complainant and the appellants were on inimical terms and some criminal proceedings were pending between them even at the time when the occurrence took place.

Originally, Pundlik (PW-1) used to stay in a village Dhamori but he shifted his residence to another village along with family members about one year before the date of incident. On the date of incident when Gangadhar (PW-2), Jayawant (PW-5) and Charandas (PW-6) and the deceased were going to village Dhamori in an auto-rickshaw, PW-1 was standing and he enquired from them as to where they were going and when he learnt that they were going to Dhamori he also accompanied them and all of them reached there at about 00 p.m. They went to the house of father-in-law of Gangadhar (PW-2) who was the Sarpanch of the village. They rested there for some time. Thereafter, PW-1 went to the weekly market along with Jayawant (PW-5), Charandas (PW-6) and the deceased. Father of PW-1 met him at the market and PW-1 told his father to purchase mutton so that he could entertain his friends at night. Thereafter, he along with his friends returned to his house. PW-1 told his mother to prepare meat for his friends and asked PWs 5 and 6 to go to the house of Raghunath (PW-3) and invite Gangadhar (PW-2) for the feast. House of accused-respondent no.1 is at a short distance from the house of PW- All the accused persons came together and assembled near the house of PW-1 and they were all armed with deadly weapons. They proceeded towards the house of PW-1 with the common object of killing PW-1 and his friends. At about 30 p.m. accused Kashirao along with other accused persons and the deceased accused formed an unlawful assembly to cause death of PW-1 and his friends. Accused no.1-Kashirao was armed with sword, Mohan was armed with an axe and other accused persons were armed with lathis. All the accused persons hurled stones at the house of Pundlik (PW-1) and threatened to kill him and his friends. When the deceased tried to escape from the rear door being afraid of assaults, the accused persons chased him and assaulted him with deadly weapons and committed his murder. Thereafter, they came back to the house of PW-1, pelted stones and when he ran away to save his life, the accused persons chased him and gave blows. As a result of the assaults given, left arm of PW-1 was severed and injuries were caused on his right arm. Another friend of PW-1 Jayawant (PW-5) was also chased, but he successfully managed to escape by getting into a State transport bus. On coming back to the house of PW-1, they shouted that they had killed one person from Amravati, others had run away and now they would kill PW- PW-1 tried to save himself by throwing tiles from the roof but he did not succeed and therefore, tried to run away from the house by jumping out from the roof. However, accused chased him and he was assaulted. Assuming him to be dead, they returned to the village. They also carried the severed arm and showed it to his mother and ran away. Mother of PW-1 went to the place where PW-1 was lying, gave him water and took him to Kolhapur Bus stand and then to Kolhapur police station. He was later on taken to the hospital. His statement was recorded and the FIR was registered. The weapons and blood stained swords were collected. The accused persons were arrested and the charge sheet was placed. Mohan is the son of accused no.1 Kashirao, Mahadeo (A-4) and Sahadeo (A-5) are real brothers and Ganesh (A-7) is the son of Ajab (A-6). All are residents of village Dhamori. After having accepted the fact that blows were given by a deadly weapon by accused-respondent no.1 Kashirao, there was no reason to hold him guilty of offence punishable under Section 326 Indian Penal Code, 1860 and not Section 302 Indian Penal Code, 1860. The fact that the accused persons were armed with deadly weapons, chased the deceased and assaulted him and came back to assault PW-1 has been established by clear, cogent and credible evidence. Additionally, merely because PW-1 was the victim intended, does not take away the effect of the common object to do an illegal act. Mere fact that instead of the original intended victim, somebody else was also assaulted and killed does not take away the rigour of Section 149 Indian Penal Code, 1860. Even if it is accepted for the sake of arguments that the deceased was chased and assaulted, the assailant alone can be convicted and others cannot be roped in by application of Section 149 Indian Penal Code, 1860. Evidence of PWs 1, 5 and 7 is cogent and credible. Merely because there was some animosity between PW-1 and accused persons as claimed by the prosecution, that cannot be a ground to discard his evidence even if it is credible and cogent. Additionally, the evidence of PWs. 5 and 7 more than strengthen the evidence of PW- They have graphically described the scenario as to how the accused persons were armed with weapons, pelted stones, chased the deceased, assaulted him, came back and assaulted PW- That being the position, the prosecution version has been amply established. The important question is as to applicability of Section 149 Indian Penal Code, 1860 to the facts of the case. Looking at the nature of the injuries, weapons used and the manner of assaults, there was no reason to apply Section 326 Indian Penal Code, 1860 in case of accused-respondent no.1 alone. The trial Court had rightly convicted the accused persons under Section 302 Indian Penal Code, 1860. The gruesome nature of the attack is amply demonstrated by the injuries noticed on the body of the deceased.", "statute": ["s1"]}, "2014.INSC.62.txt": {"doc_url": "http://www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/2014/62.html", "explanation": {"Accused-2 Radhey caught hold of Balram and assaulted him with a Kulhari.": ["s3", "s1"], "Later on, Accused-3 Battu dealt an axe blow on his throat.": ["s3", "s1"], "Others too continued assaulting Balram.": ["s3", "s1"], "Accused-1 Sheesh Ram followed Bhagwan Singh, caught hold of him and inflicted injuries on him.": ["s3", "s1"], "Other accused also inflicted injuries on him.": ["s3", "s1"], "He succumbed to the injuries.": ["s3"]}, "fact": " ##  SHEESHRAM & ORS. v.

secondly, the theory propounded by the defence that it was done in the exercise of right to private defence is baseless and has been rightly rejected; thirdly, that the evidence led on behalf of the prosecution, the eye witness account by Basanti Bai PW-7 and the other substantial evidence of recovery of the blood stained articles and clothes is fully established.": ["s1"]}, "fact": " Shortly stated the prosecution case is that one Basanti Bai, PW-7 lodged a report with police station Raipur, District Jhalawar on 1997 at about 4:30 p.m. to the effect that her sons, Shayam Lal and Balkishan were belaboured by the seven accused persons. It was further stated that the appellant Bheru Lal and Kailash Chandra had inflicted sword blows on the left and right hand and neck of Shayam Lal while appellant Purushottam and Gopal gave sword and spear blows, respectively, on the back and head of Balkishan. Thus all the appellants had indiscriminately inflicted injuries on the person of deceased Shayam Lal and Balkishan, while appellant Girraj and Bheru Lal crushed their heads with stones. It was further alleged that after this ghastly incident, the appellants had set at fire the tractor trolley, stack of onion and groundnut. Basanti Bai, PW-7, undoubtedly, was an interested witness being mother of the deceased persons. Some evidence has come on record that everything was not well between the two families of the deceased and the accused. Her evidence was, therefore, dubbed as the \"evidence of an interested witness\". Her evidence was criticized as untrustworthy and unnatural. The other witnesses, namely, Ram Prasad (PW-3), Kanwar Lal (PW-5) and Puri Lal (PW-6) have not chosen to support the prosecution and they were rightly declared hostile. We have, therefore, gone through the evidence of Basanti Bai very closely. There can be no dispute that in her evidence, she has also roped in Girraj (original accused no. 6), Badam Bai (co-accused) and Tara Bai (co- accused) and that was an exaggeration on her part. She claimed to have seen the incident from some distance, but has graphically described the role played by accused Bheru Lal, Kailash Chandra and Purushottam, the appellants herein. According to her, Bheru Lal had given a sword blow on the neck of Shayam Lal and Kailash Chandra gave a sword blow on the hand of Shayam Lal, while Gopal gave a blow with a sword on the neck of Balkishan and Purushottam hit Balkishan with Ballam (spear like weapon). She has not stopped here, but has assigned a role specifically to Girraj, Badam Bai and Tara Bai, as also her daughters-in-law, saying that they also gave blows with the sticks. She then described that Bheru Lal pelted stones on them and the other accused persons also stoned them, as a result of which their heads were crushed. She has thereafter said that even she was followed up to the house and thereafter, the accused persons set articles in her house and tractor on fire. There could hardly be any doubt regarding the presence of this witness on the spot. She candidly admitted that when her sons Balkishan and Shayam Lal had left the house, they might have taken gun and a katta (country made revolver) with them. She, however, denied that the said gun and the katta were lying near the bodies of her sons. She naturally refuted the suggestions made to her that her sons had gone armed only to give beating to Kailash Chandra and Purushottam. She also refuted the suggestion that village persons had given beating to her sons. She asserted that she did not see any injury on Kailash Chandra at the place of occurrence and no such injury was caused to Kailash Chandra by any sharp edged weapon. Significantly enough, there is not even an iota of cross-examination in respect of the incident and her version about the assault by the accused on her sons and the same has totally gone unchallenged. There can be no dispute about her being an interested witness, as also her having exaggerated her version. There can also be no dispute that she has specifically denied there being any injuries on Kailash Chandra, which injuries were ultimately proved. However, that by itself, will not make her evidence unbelievable. We have taken into consideration that here was a mother, who was deposing about the assault on her sons and she certainly would not be interested in allowing the real culprits to go unpunished. About the gun and the katta being found near the body, the witness has specifically refuted the suggestion that the deceased persons had gone there with an idea to assault the accused persons. In fact, there were as many as 7 accused persons. Dr. Chandra Kishore Srivastava in his evidence has established that he had examined Kailash Chandra and found that he had suffered as many as 11 injuries. Kailash Chandra himself also, when he entered the witness box, established his own injuries. There can be no dispute that Kailash Chandra had suffered injuries on that day. The evidence of the doctor shows that he had suffered 10 incised wounds. Most of the injuries were on the left side of the body, one of them on the left hand, one on left wrist, one on left palm and one on the scapular region. The other injuries were on the right upper arm on the lower side. The other injuries include two injuries on the right upper arm on the lower side while one appears to be on left frontal part of the head 3 inch above the left eyebrow. The doctor has certified that all these injuries including even the contusion suffered was a simple injury, that is clear from the report exhibit B- In his cross-examination, the doctor very specifically admitted that none of the injury was serious in nature nor was any one of them sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature and they were simple. There can be no dispute that this evidence was scanned by the trial Court and the Appellate Court which held that the injuries, even if they were established to have been suffered by Kailash Chandra, were extremely insignificant injuries and, therefore, those injuries did not need any explanation on the part of the prosecution. The witness undoubtedly states in her cross examination, \"I did not see any injury to the Kailash Chandra on spot. Kailash Chandra was not injured with sharp weapon\". Thus it is very doubtful as to whether the injuries had been caused at the time of occurrence as such. Kailash Chandra, undoubtedly, has suffered some injuries, but all those injuries are simple in nature. We have seen the Injury Report (Exhibit D-2), which suggests that they were very insignificant injuries, which were placed not on the vital portions of the body. We have very carefully seen the cross-examination of Basanti Bai, who was not even asked about the deceased being armed with any sharp edged weapon, so as to cause injuries to Kailash Chandra, who sustained about 10 incised wounds, attributable only to the assault by a sharp weapon. There was no recovery of any sharp edged weapon from the place of incident or even from the person of the deceased and even the Investigating Officer was not asked anything about any sharp edged weapon being used by the deceased. The accused persons had shown the courage to enter the witness box. We have seen their evidence carefully. However, we are of the opinion that their evidence does not take us too far nor is their evidence reliable in view of the inter se contradictions in the evidence of Kailash Chandra and Bheru Lal regarding the presence of Gopal and Girraj. Nothing has come out in the prosecution case, suggesting that the appellants were put under the situation, where they could reasonably had apprehended any grievous hurt to even one of them. On the other hand, the defence came out with a fantastic theory that the deceased persons were killed by the villagers. When Kailash Chandra stepped into the witness box, he deposed that deceased Shayam Lal had a spear in his hand and a loaded Katta in his pocket. He further evidenced that Balkishan and Shayam Lal abused his sister and mother and pointed out the gun at them and when Balkishan's gun failed to fire, he attacked with sword on his right hand at several places. He further asserted that had he not taken sword in his hand, he would have died. In his examination- in-chief also he had suggested that Balkishan had a sword besides a 12 bore loaded gun. In his cross examination, he claimed complete ignorance as to what had happened with Balkishan and Shayam Lal. He also went to the extent of suggesting that he did not know as to how they died. It is very significant to see that the evidence of DW-2 Bherulal also is to the same effect that Balkishan was beating Kailash Chandra with the sword and he also had a gun with him. Bherulal was at least candid enough to admit that Shayam Lal and Balkishan had died in the same incident, however, both these witnesses brought about a fantastic theory that villagers had attacked Balkishan and Shayam Lal and they were killed in the same incident. What is most significant is that Kailash Chandra and Bherulal, after the incident, chose to go to Sunair after five hours of the incident and did not go to Raipur police station under which jurisdiction all this had taken place. It is after reaching Sunair that Kailash Chandra chose to go to the hospital at Sunair. There can be no doubt that they claimed to have been injured in the same incident but that by itself would not be sufficient because there does not appear to be any sword seized by the police on the spot. If Balkishan and Shayam Lal had carried a sword for injuring this witness and if both of them died on the spot, surely the sword could not have disappeared. Therefore, both the Courts were right in disbelieving the story put forth by these two accused-witnesses. As per the evidence, the report was made in the police station Sunair which was about 15 KM from the village Himmatgarh. There can be no dispute about the proposition that the injuries on the person of the accused must be explained. However, considering the overall evidence of the two defence witnesses, it is extremely doubtful whether the injuries were caused during the incident. This is apart from the fact that Basanti Bai who had seen the incident from a distance could not have been in a position to even notice any injury on the body of Kailash Chandra. She had afterall seen her two sons being assaulted mercilessly and being dealt with by the accused. She, therefore, asserted that she did not see any injury at that time on the person of Kailash Chandra. Once Basanti Bai's evidence is believed then there would be no question of going to any other piece of evidence as her evidence by itself is sufficient to convict the accused as was rightly done by the Trial Court and the Appellate Court. This is apart from the fact that the recovery memo exhibitP-11, P-12, P-13 and P-14 through which blood stained spear, blood stained lathi, blood stained sword were recovered from Bheru Lal, Kailash Chandra, Purushottam and Gopal as also exhibit 15, the recovery memo of the blood stained clothes which were recovered from Bherulal as also exhibit C-1, the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) report provide enough corroboration to the evidence of Basanti Bai. We are, therefore, of the considered opinion that: \"firstly, it is completely established that the appellants as also the other accused who has not filed appeal had caused the murder of Shayam Lal and Balkishan; secondly, the theory propounded by the defence that it was done in the exercise of right to private defence is baseless and has been rightly rejected; thirdly, that the evidence led on behalf of the prosecution, the eye witness account by Basanti Bai PW-7 and the other substantial evidence of recovery of the blood stained articles and clothes is fully established.", "statute": ["s1"]}, "2001.INSC.640.txt": {"doc_url": "http://www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/2001/640.html", "explanation": {"On 1984, at about 8O clock while PW-1 Hari Singh, nephew of deceased Halkiya was working in his field, PW-2 Harnam Singh came and told that his uncle Halkiya was lying injured near the field of Udham Singh.": ["s1"], "According to PW-1, injured Halkiya had told PW-1 that he was assaulted by nine persons.": ["s1"], "The names of all these persons were given by PW-1 in the F.I.": ["s1"], "statement.": ["s1"], "On the basis of statement given by PW-1, a case was registered against these nine persons and the body of Halkiya was sent for post-mortem examination.": ["s1"], "PW-4 conducted the post-mortem examination and found that there was an incise wound on the right side of the skull of the deceased, possibly caused by a hard and blunt object.": ["s1"], "There were two other incised wounds, alleged to have been caused by hard and sharp cutting object on the right hand.": ["s1"], "The Doctor was of the opinion that after sustaining these injuries, Halkiya must have been alive for 2-4 hours.": ["s1"], "It is important to note that the witnesses not only reached the place of incident but also took steps to take the deceased in a bullock cart to the nearby hospital and this shows that deceased Halkiya must have been alive at that time.": ["s1"], "While the injured was being taken in the bullock cart, on the way he died and thereafter the dead body was directly taken to the Police Station.": ["s1"], "The names of the appellants were disclosed by the deceased to three witnesses who gave their evidence before the court and the two courts accepted that evidence and did not find any infirmity or miscarriage of justice in this case.": ["s1"]}, "fact": " On 1984, at about 8O clock while PW-1 Hari Singh, nephew of deceased Halkiya was working in his field, PW-2 Harnam Singh came and told that his uncle Halkiya was lying injured near the field of Udham Singh. PW-1 rushed to the place and saw Halkiya lying injured. On the way he had informed Patel Pritam Singh( PW-6) and also Chowkidar Munni Lal (PW-5). Brother of PW-1 brought a bullock cart to take the injured Halkiya to hospital, but on the way Halkiya died and the bullock cart was diverted to the police station, which was about 8 Kms. away from the place of incident. PW-1 lodged the F.I. statement before the Station Officer. According to PW-1, injured Halkiya had told PW-1 that he was assaulted by nine persons. The names of all these persons were given by PW-1 in the F.I. statement. On the basis of statement given by PW-1, a case was registered against these nine persons and the body of Halkiya was sent for post-mortem examination. PW-4 conducted the post-mortem examination and found that there was an incise wound on the right side of the skull of the deceased, possibly caused by a hard and blunt object. There were two other incised wounds, alleged to have been caused by hard and sharp cutting object on the right hand. In addition, there were 8 contusions on the various parts of the body. The Doctor was of the opinion that after sustaining these injuries, Halkiya must have been alive for 2-4 hours. PW-1 Hari Singh gave the evidence to the effect that when he reached the place of incident and found that Halkiya was lying injured in the pathway leading from Rusia to Aron, he enquired as to who had assaulted and then Halkiya told the names of all the persons. PW-1 also deposed that he had gone to PW-5 Munni Lal and PW-6 Pritam Singh on his way to the place of incident. He further stated that PW-5 Munni Lal reached the place of incident and the condition of Halkiya was bad and he could give only the names of four persons and then his brother Kallu reached there with the bullock cart and the injured was taken to Aron. PW-2 Harnam Singh deposed that on the date of incident at about 7 oclock in the morning he went to the house of Patel Hartoom Singh to get a loan application. While he was coming back, he saw Halkiya lying on the pathway near the field of Udham Singh. He went near the injured Halkiya who told him that nine persons including these appellants had attacked him with lathis and farsas. PW-3 also deposed that Halkiya gave out the names of persons who had attacked him. According to PW-2 Harnam Singh, the injured Halkiya disclosed the names of Meharban Singh, Halke Bhaya, Bhagwat Singh, Bhayalal, Jagannath, Udham Singh and Ram Swaroop. It is important to note that the witnesses not only reached the place of incident but also took steps to take the deceased in a bullock cart to the nearby hospital and this shows that deceased Halkiya must have been alive at that time. While the injured was being taken in the bullock cart, on the way he died and thereafter the dead body was directly taken to the Police Station. There, the First Information Report was lodged and in the FIR, it is mentioned that dead body of Halkiya was in the Police Station. The names of the appellants were disclosed by the deceased to three witnesses who gave their evidence before the court and the two courts accepted that evidence and did not find any infirmity or miscarriage of justice in this case.", "statute": ["s1"]}, "1998.INSC.343.txt": {"doc_url": "http://www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/1998/343.html", "explanation": {"The shot fired by Ram Padarath (Respondent no.1) injured Boudhu.": ["s1"], "After walking a few steps he fell down in a nearby field where he was given a blow by Ram Sugarath with a 'katta' on his head.": ["s1"], "He died immediately.": ["s1"], "The eye witnesses had deposed that a 'katta' blow was given by accused Ram Sugarath above the back side of neck of Boudhu.": ["s1"], "Dr.Bhagat (PW 4) who had done the post mortem examination had found three injuries on him.": ["s1"], "Two were bullet wounds and 3rd was an incised wound on the vertax.": ["s1"], "Out of the two bullet wounds, one was any entry wound and other was an exit wound.": ["s1"], "The bullet had entered from the left temporal area and gone out from the right occipital bone one inch behind the right ear.": ["s1"], "According to the doctor brain substance could be seen from that wound.": ["s1"], "As regards the 3rd injury the doctor had stated that it could have been caused by a weapon like 'katta'.": ["s1"], "Thus according to the medical evidence there was no injury on the neck of Boudhu which could have been caused by a katta blow.": ["s1"], "It is true that no eye witnesses had stated that any katta blow was given on the head of Boudhu.": ["s1"], "Thus apparently the eye witnesses did stand contradicted by the medical evidence as regards these two injuries.": ["s1"], "But what the High Court failed to appreciate was that all the eye witnesses had seen the incident from some distance.v After being hit by the shot fired by Ram Padarath, Boudhu had walked a few steps and then the katta blow was given. Boudhu was surrounded by the accused at that time. It was under these circumstances that the eye witnesses had committed a mistake in describing the part of the head of Boudhu on which the katta blow had fallen. It was an impression which they had carried when they either saw the blow being given or saw the injuries on Boudhu after going near the place where he had fallen down. The wound which was found above the neck and behind the right ear was 1 inch long 3/4 inch wide and bone deep. It was almost similar in size and shape to the wound which was found on the vertax. If under these circumstances, labouring under some confusion they stated that the katta blow had fallen on the neck of Boudhu, then on the basis of such an inconsistency or discrepancy it was no proper for the court to raise a doubt regarding the witnesses having seen the actual assault on Boudhu. The High court also did not read and appreciate the evidences of the eye witnesses correctly when it stated that according to them some flesh had bulged out of the wound on the neck. We find that what the witnesses had stated was that the muscle of that part of the neck was cut. What the Doctor had stated with respect to the wound was that brain substance could be seen inside the wound. If really the witnesses had not seen the assault and had given their statement only after seeing the injuries on the dead bodies of Boudhu, as observed by the High Court, then they would not have committed such a mistake and they would have stated that the katta blow was given on the head and not on the neck of Boudhu. The eye witnesses have consistently stated that Boudhu was hit twice - once by the shot fired by Ram Padarath and the second time by the katta blwo given by Ram Sugarath, even though there were three injuries on the head of Boudhu. If the evidence of the eye witnesses is read carefully, it clearly appears that wheat they stated was that the shot fired by Ram Padarath had caused an entry wound on the forehead, the 'katta' blow and caused an injury on the neck and the wound on the vertax was the exit wound. No doubt, to that extent their evidence can be said to inconsistent with the medical evidence. The inconsistency clearly appears to be the result of confusion and does not indicate an attempt to describe the incident by a person who had not really seen it. The reasoning of the High Court was that if the shot fired by Dilip had hit Mangal while running away then in that case the bullet injury would have been found on the back side of the thigh of Mangal and not on its front side, and as the injury was found on the front side that indicated that the version given by eye witnesses was not correct. The High Court also observed that it was not believable that mangal had the courage to turn back and see what the assailants were doing after they had killed Boudhu. What the High Court failed to appreciate was that it was not a matter of courage but it was the instinct of self preservation which could have prompted Mangal to look back, as he was also being chased. His brother was chased and beaten by the accused who were sworn enemies. It was for that reason that he had started running away from that place. It was therefore not only probable but quite natural for him after covering some distance to look back to find out whether he was being chased or not. Therefore, the evidence of the eye-witnesses that while running away Mangal was shouting 'Bachao' 'Bachao' and the shot fired by dilip had hit him on his thigh, when he had turned back for a moment while running was really not inconsistent with the medical evidence and deserved to be accepted. The High Court failed to appreciate that the incident had happened near the embankment at a little distance from Koria Haibatpur Chowk. Nothing was brought out in the evidence of any of the prosecution witnesses, including the investigating officer, to indicate that any other person was present near the place of the incident or that he had seen the incident. If independent persons were not willing to tell the police that they had seen the incident, the prosecution can not be blamed for not examining independent persons as eye witnesses and veracity of the evidence of the witnesses examined as eye witnesses cannot be doubted on that ground. Though the fact that their names did not appear as eye-witnesses in the FIR was a relevant circumstance, the evidence each of these two eye witnesses was required to be appreciated on its own merits. Apart from the general grounds stated above, the High Court rejected the evidence of PW 7 on the ground that it was improbable, his conduct was unnatural and that he had made material improvements while giving evidence in the Court. We fail to appreciate how the circumstance that he was walking behind his brother at some distance can be regarded as improbable merely because they had started together from village Basudevpur. They had covered quite a long distance by the time they had reached Koria - Haibatpur. Subhash could have remained behind for various reasons. It was not an improbability and particularly when no explanation was sought from the witnesses in that behalf, correctness of the evidence of PW 7 should not have been doubted on the basis of this circumstance. If subhash was at a little distance from his brothers when they were attacked then he being young man could have run away from that place before he could be attacked. PW 7 had reached Begusarai within a short time and lodged a complaint and that makes his version that he was with his brothers when they were assaulted more probable. If he had come to know about the incident later, after learning about it from somebody, then he would not have been able to lodge the complaint at Begusarai so quickly. vMoreover, his evidence that they were going together from village Basudevpur to Begusarai, deserved to be believed as the incident had taken place at Koria Haibatpur through which they had to pass for going to Begusarai.": ["s1"], "After being hit by the shot fired by Ram Padarath, Boudhu had walked a few steps and then the katta blow was given.": ["s1"], "Boudhu was surrounded by the accused at that time.": ["s1"], "It was under these circumstances that the eye witnesses had committed a mistake in describing the part of the head of Boudhu on which the katta blow had fallen.": ["s1"], "It was an impression which they had carried when they either saw the blow being given or saw the injuries on Boudhu after going near the place where he had fallen down.": ["s1"], "The wound which was found above the neck and behind the right ear was 1 inch long 3/4 inch wide and bone deep.": ["s1"], "It was almost similar in size and shape to the wound which was found on the vertax.": ["s1"], "If under these circumstances, labouring under some confusion they stated that the katta blow had fallen on the neck of Boudhu, then on the basis of such an inconsistency or discrepancy it was no proper for the court to raise a doubt regarding the witnesses having seen the actual assault on Boudhu.": ["s1"], "The High court also did not read and appreciate the evidences of the eye witnesses correctly when it stated that according to them some flesh had bulged out of the wound on the neck.": ["s1"], "We find that what the witnesses had stated was that the muscle of that part of the neck was cut.": ["s1"], "What the Doctor had stated with respect to the wound was that brain substance could be seen inside the wound.": ["s1"], "If really the witnesses had not seen the assault and had given their statement only after seeing the injuries on the dead bodies of Boudhu, as observed by the High Court, then they would not have committed such a mistake and they would have stated that the katta blow was given on the head and not on the neck of Boudhu.": ["s1"], "The eye witnesses have consistently stated that Boudhu was hit twice - once by the shot fired by Ram Padarath and the second time by the katta blwo given by Ram Sugarath, even though there were three injuries on the head of Boudhu.": ["s1"], "If the evidence of the eye witnesses is read carefully, it clearly appears that wheat they stated was that the shot fired by Ram Padarath had caused an entry wound on the forehead, the 'katta' blow and caused an injury on the neck and the wound on the vertax was the exit wound.

morning for going to Begusarai. At about 9'O clock, when they were passing by the 'bandh' (embankment) near village Koria - Haibatpur, accused Ram Padarath, Ram Susgarath, Ramsubodh, Bipin, Dilip (absconding) who were armed with pistols and 'Katta' attacked them, because of the previous enmity with the informant and his brother. Boudhu and Mangal who were walking ahead of subhash became their Targets. The shot fired by Ram Padarath (Respondent no.1) injured Boudhu. After walking a few steps he fell down in a nearby field where he was given a blow by Ram Sugarath with a 'katta' on his head. He died immediately. Mangal who had started running away from that place shouting 'Bachao Bachao' was hit by a shot fired by Dilip. After covering some distance he fell down and at that time ram subodh (Respondent no.2) Vipin and Ram Sugarath attacked him by giving 'katta' blows and killed him. Subhash who was walking behind his two brothers was able to run away from that place before he could be attacked. He straight went to Begusarai, after catching a bus on the way, got a complaint written by his brother-in-law who was an advocate and presented it at Begusarai police Station. On the basis of this complaint an offence was registered against all the five accused for the offences punishable under Sections 147, 148 and 302/149 Indian Penal Code, 1860 and against Ram Padarath and Dilip for the offence punishable under Section 27 of the Arms Act. As accused Dilip and Ramsugarath were found absconding, the trial proceeded against the remaining three accused. The eye witnesses had deposed that a 'katta' blow was given by accused Ram Sugarath above the back side of neck of Boudhu. Dr.Bhagat (PW 4) who had done the post mortem examination had found three injuries on him. Two were bullet wounds and 3rd was an incised wound on the vertax. Out of the two bullet wounds, one was any entry wound and other was an exit wound. The bullet had entered from the left temporal area and gone out from the right occipital bone one inch behind the right ear. According to the doctor brain substance could be seen from that wound. As regards the 3rd injury the doctor had stated that it could have been caused by a weapon like 'katta'. Thus according to the medical evidence there was no injury on the neck of Boudhu which could have been caused by a katta blow. It is true that no eye witnesses had stated that any katta blow was given on the head of Boudhu. Thus apparently the eye witnesses did stand contradicted by the medical evidence as regards these two injuries. But what the High Court failed to appreciate was that all the eye witnesses had seen the incident from some distance.v After being hit by the shot fired by Ram Padarath, Boudhu had walked a few steps and then the katta blow was given. Boudhu was surrounded by the accused at that time. It was under these circumstances that the eye witnesses had committed a mistake in describing the part of the head of Boudhu on which the katta blow had fallen. It was an impression which they had carried when they either saw the blow being given or saw the injuries on Boudhu after going near the place where he had fallen down. The wound which was found above the neck and behind the right ear was 1 inch long 3/4 inch wide and bone deep. It was almost similar in size and shape to the wound which was found on the vertax. If under these circumstances, labouring under some confusion they stated that the katta blow had fallen on the neck of Boudhu, then on the basis of such an inconsistency or discrepancy it was no proper for the court to raise a doubt regarding the witnesses having seen the actual assault on Boudhu. The High court also did not read and appreciate the evidences of the eye witnesses correctly when it stated that according to them some flesh had bulged out of the wound on the neck. We find that what the witnesses had stated was that the muscle of that part of the neck was cut. What the Doctor had stated with respect to the wound was that brain substance could be seen inside the wound. If really the witnesses had not seen the assault and had given their statement only after seeing the injuries on the dead bodies of Boudhu, as observed by the High Court, then they would not have committed such a mistake and they would have stated that the katta blow was given on the head and not on the neck of Boudhu. The eye witnesses have consistently stated that Boudhu was hit twice - once by the shot fired by Ram Padarath and the second time by the katta blwo given by Ram Sugarath, even though there were three injuries on the head of Boudhu. If the evidence of the eye witnesses is read carefully, it clearly appears that wheat they stated was that the shot fired by Ram Padarath had caused an entry wound on the forehead, the 'katta' blow and caused an injury on the neck and the wound on the vertax was the exit wound. No doubt, to that extent their evidence can be said to inconsistent with the medical evidence. The inconsistency clearly appears to be the result of confusion and does not indicate an attempt to describe the incident by a person who had not really seen it. The reasoning of the High Court was that if the shot fired by Dilip had hit Mangal while running away then in that case the bullet injury would have been found on the back side of the thigh of Mangal and not on its front side, and as the injury was found on the front side that indicated that the version given by eye witnesses was not correct. The High Court also observed that it was not believable that mangal had the courage to turn back and see what the assailants were doing after they had killed Boudhu. What the High Court failed to appreciate was that it was not a matter of courage but it was the instinct of self preservation which could have prompted Mangal to look back, as he was also being chased. His brother was chased and beaten by the accused who were sworn enemies. It was for that reason that he had started running away from that place. It was therefore not only probable but quite natural for him after covering some distance to look back to find out whether he was being chased or not. Therefore, the evidence of the eye-witnesses that while running away Mangal was shouting 'Bachao' 'Bachao' and the shot fired by dilip had hit him on his thigh, when he had turned back for a moment while running was really not inconsistent with the medical evidence and deserved to be accepted. The High Court failed to appreciate that the incident had happened near the embankment at a little distance from Koria Haibatpur Chowk. Nothing was brought out in the evidence of any of the prosecution witnesses, including the investigating officer, to indicate that any other person was present near the place of the incident or that he had seen the incident. If independent persons were not willing to tell the police that they had seen the incident, the prosecution can not be blamed for not examining independent persons as eye witnesses and veracity of the evidence of the witnesses examined as eye witnesses cannot be doubted on that ground. Though the fact that their names did not appear as eye-witnesses in the FIR was a relevant circumstance, the evidence each of these two eye witnesses was required to be appreciated on its own merits. Apart from the general grounds stated above, the High Court rejected the evidence of PW 7 on the ground that it was improbable, his conduct was unnatural and that he had made material improvements while giving evidence in the Court. We fail to appreciate how the circumstance that he was walking behind his brother at some distance can be regarded as improbable merely because they had started together from village Basudevpur. They had covered quite a long distance by the time they had reached Koria - Haibatpur. Subhash could have remained behind for various reasons. It was not an improbability and particularly when no explanation was sought from the witnesses in that behalf, correctness of the evidence of PW 7 should not have been doubted on the basis of this circumstance. If subhash was at a little distance from his brothers when they were attacked then he being young man could have run away from that place before he could be attacked. PW 7 had reached Begusarai within a short time and lodged a complaint and that makes his version that he was with his brothers when they were assaulted more probable. If he had come to know about the incident later, after learning about it from somebody, then he would not have been able to lodge the complaint at Begusarai so quickly. vMoreover, his evidence that they were going together from village Basudevpur to Begusarai, deserved to be believed as the incident had taken place at Koria Haibatpur through which they had to pass for going to Begusarai. PW 7 and Mangal were staying at Basudevpur and Boudhu was staying at Begusarai. Unless Boudhu had earlier came to Basudevpur, as stated by PW 7, they could not have been together at Koria Haibatpur. The High Court failed to appreciate that this circumstance provided independent corroboration to the evidence of PW Another reason given by the High Court for holding his evidence improbable is that he had not inquired from his two brothers, the reason why he was being taken to Begusarai. What the High Court failed to appreciate was that he was the youngest brother and his eldest brother who had come from Begusarai to Basudevpur had told him to accompany him as he had some work. What the High Court missed to consider was that the incident had happened at 9 A.M. on 86 and the post mortem examination was conducted at 9 A.M. on Therefore, the circumstance that no money was found from the pockets of the deceased at the time of post mortem examination should not have been utilized by the High Court to hold that the version of PW 7 was improbable. The very fact that the incident had happened at Koria Haitbatpur and not at Basudevpur where Subhash was staying nor at Begusarai where Bough was staying indicates that they were going from one place to the other. The High court also failed to consider that there was no evidence to show that Subhash also had no money with him when the incident happened. The evidence of PW 7 was considered improbable also on the ground that the accused would not have failed to prevent subhash from running away by firing a shot at him. As already stated earlier Subhash was at some distance from his two brothers when the incident had happened and had started running away from the place as soon as he had seen the assault on his brothers. Subhahsh being a young man of 28 years of age must have covered quite a long distance by that time. It was quite probable that the accused did not think it fit to fire a shot at him. It is difficult to appreciate how this part of the evidence of the eye witnesses can be regarded as improbable. It is true that he did not rush back to his village after the incident to inform his relatives or friends. But seeing the murderous assault on his two brothers by their enemies, if PW 7 though it fit to rush to the police station, his conduct cannot be regarded as unnatural. It is not unknown that different persons react differently when placed under such circumstances. For the same reason his not going to Boudhu's house to inform his widow about the incident cannot be regarded as a piece of unnatural conduct. Nor was it proper to consider his conduct unnatural on the ground that before reaching the police station he had first gone to his brother-in-law's house. He was a villager. he wanted to lodge a complaint. His brother- in-law was an advocated. Before the Court he had stated the number of shots fired by the accused and the parts of the bodies of Boudhu and Mangal on which injuries were caused by them. In the FIR he had not given all these details. But he had stated in the FIR that while he was going from Basudevpur to Begusarai along with his two brothers and while they were passing by the embankment near Koria Haibatpur, the accused had attacked his two brothers who were walking ahead of him. He had also stated that injuries were caused to them by firing a shot and by giving 'katta blows'. Thus he had stated the weapons with which injuries were caused to his two brothers. By stating that his brothers were injured by the accused 'by firing a short' he did not mean that only one shot was fired, as wrongly understood by the High Court. It was not his version that by one shot both his brothers were injured. On seeing the assault on his two brothers, he had started running away from the place. He might not have seen at that time how many 'katta' blows were given by the accused to his two brothers and on which parts of their bodies injuries were caused. If the High Court had considered this aspect then possibly it would not have held that the witness had made material improvements while giving evidence in the Court. The High Court disbelieved his evidence also on the ground that his brother-in-law Radhey Shyam Singh who was an advocate and who had accompanied him to the police station had not signed the complaint. There was no reason for his brother-in-law to sign that complaint. We are also of the view that the High Court was not right in discarding the evidence of eye witness Navin Rai. While it is true that his name was not mentioned in the FIR, no importance should have given to that omission, in view of the circumstances in which PW 7 had left the place of incident and lodged the FIR. Earlier, we have pointed out how the medical evidence is not inconsistent with the evidence on a flimsy ground that he had not produced the empty vessel in which he had carried milk for supplying it to Ramji Singh. In the cross examination of witness nothing has been brought out to show that there was any reason for him to falsely involve the accused. He was neither close with the family of the deceased nor inimical to the accused. Like Navin Rai he as also an independent witness and his evidence should not have been discarded on the ground that his name did not appear in the register of the doctor, to when he had gone for taking medicine and that he had not produced the prescription before the police.", "statute": ["s1"]}, "2012.INSC.629.txt": {"doc_url": "http://www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/2012/629.html", "explanation": {"On 16.11.2006 at about 15:00 Hrs.

Palem village. Al, A3, A4 and A6 to A19 are the followers of A P.Ws. to 3 belong to the group of Chandra Tirupathaiah. The wife of A5 and the mother of Chandra Tirupathaiah i.e. Chandra Punnamma contested in the Panchayat elections and was elected as Sarpanch of the village. Since then the group of the accused was waiting for an opportunity to prove their supremacy in the village. While so, on 1998 at about 00 A.M. , A.6 and Kilari Manoz and Chintagumpala Vamsee went to the Pathuri lands of Kilari Venkata Subbamma and others to graze their cattle. After some time at about 30 A.M. , Chintagumpala Sunil, Chandra Murali and Chintagumpala Manohar also went to the Pathuri lands of Kilari Venkata Subbamma and others for answering the calls of 2 nature and they met A.6 and Kilari Manoz and Chinthagumpala Vamsee there. A6 enquired from Chandra Murali about the cricket match, as to whether it was ended as draw by calling as \"cricket raddaindira\". Then, he replied in the same manner by calling A6 as \"match raddu kaledura\". By hearing such reply, A6 felt offended and grew wild against Chandra Murali and picked up quarrel with him, and there was a scuffle between them. Kilari Manoz went to the village and informed about the quarrel between A6 and Chandra Murali to the elders and A.2, in spite of the request made by Chintagumpala Manohar not to do so. On the same day, at about 00 noon, A2 went to the house of Chintagumpala Manohar and kicked him on his stomach for his prevention and interference with Kilari Manoz when he was proceeding to the village for informing the quarrel to the elders. P.W.3, who is the father of P.W.6, on his return from the field came to know about beating of his son by A2, he went to Ramalayam Street questioning loudly about the illegal and high-handed act of A P.Ws.1 and 2 and Chandra Venkateshwarlu (hereinafter referred to as the `deceased') tried their best to convince P.W.3 to adjust the matter. A6, who was passing through the street, heard the cries of P.W.3 and picked up quarrel with him. At about 00 p.m. Al and A3 to A19 armed with deadly weapons beat the deceased and also injured P.Ws.1 to A-1 beat P.W.1 with an iron rod on his head. A12 also beat P.W.1 with a stick on his shoulder. A5 beat P.W.2 with a stick on his head and hands. A-1 beat P.W.3 with an axe on his head and A- 3 11 beat P.W.3 with a stick on his eyebrows. A2 beat the deceased with a stick on his back. A-1 also beat the deceased with an iron rod on his head and all over the body. As a result the deceased fell down with injuries and became unconscious. PWs 1 to 3 fell down with injuries. All the accused hurled stones against P.Ws.1 to 3 and the deceased. All the accused left the place thereafter. At about 00 p.m. P.Ws.1 to 3 went to Lingasamudram Police Station, where P.W.1 gave a statement to the police. P.W.9 recorded the statement of P.W.1 and registered a case in Cr.

It is also the case of the prosecution that as a result of the aforesaid stab injuries given to the deceased, he expired on the same day i.e. on 19.04.1988.  P.S. Joaquim Dias (PW-21) who was attached to the Ponda Police Station as P.S.I. received a phone call at about 10.45 p.m. from P.S.I. K.K. Desai of the Panaji Police Station that a person named Rauji Dulba Sawant had been brought in police jeep by police constable Jaisingrao Rane and that while he was being taken to the Goa Medical College, he expired.  He was informed that the deceased had died as a result of stab injuries received and, therefore, he was to take necessary steps.  On receipt of the aforesaid message, PW-21 along with ASI Tabit Mamlekar went to the scene of offence.  They reached the scene of offence at about 11.30 p.m. but found the entire place plunged into darkness and with the help of torch light, PW-21 surveyed the scene of offence.  During the survey made at the place of occurrence, PW-21 noticed some blood-stains in the 2 front courtyard of the house and a pipe of length of about 1 foot or slightly less lying in the courtyard having blood-stains.  Thereafter, PW-21, along with P.I. D'Sa gave a call to the inmates of the house to open the door and on hearing the call, one lady opened the door.  On enquiring from her, PW- 21 learnt that her name was `Yeshoda' who was later on arrayed as Accused No. 3.  Two juvenile girls named, Sarita and Sharmila, who are the sisters of the appellant were found in the house.  In the meantime, PW-1, PW-2 and PW-8 came to the house from whom PW-21 made certain inquiries and brought them along with Accused No. 3 and her two juvenile girls to the Police Station.  Not finding the appellant and accused no.2 in the house, Dy.  S.P. Shri Raikar and P.I. Shri Alan O'Sa were sent in their search.  After reaching the police station, a complaint, which is marked as Exhibit PW 1/A was lodged by PW-1, in which it was alleged that PW-1, PW-8, PW-18, the deceased Rauji and his brother Narayan were residing in one house in Banastari and they used to share a common kitchen between them.  It was further alleged by PW-1 that two or three days before the Ganesh Festival, deceased Rauji had informed Narayan that he would install statue of Lord Ganesh in the house and accordingly, he had purchased the same.  Religious ceremony was performed by installing the statue of Lord Ganesh in the house and while the said religious ceremony was being performed, Accused No. 2 started uttering insults while standing in the 3 kitchen.  Accused No. 3 told the appellant not to do anything in the ceremony and insulted the family members of Rauji.  PW-1 also alleged that on 19.04.1988 the deceased Rauji returned from his duty at about 6.30 p.m. and thereafter went to purchase some articles.  On his return, he went to take bath and after having bath, he went and switched off the light of the room.  As soon as the deceased switched off the light, the appellant came from the room and started abusing Rauji.  There was a heated exchange of words between Rauji and the appellant switched on the light, which was again switched off by Rauji, the deceased.  Thereupon, the appellant went and removed the fuse of the said light.  Accused No. 3 had then lit a kerosene lamp and brought the same in the hall.  There was already an oil lamp burning which was attached to the ceiling by a brass chain.  Meanwhile, Accused No. 3 started abusing PW-1, PW-8, PW-18, and the deceased Rauji.  Thereafter, the appellant and the two other alleged accused namely, Accused Nos. 2 and 3 and the two juvenile offenders gathered in the hall to assaultRauji, the deceased, PW-1 and PW-8.  According to PW-1, in order to avoid the assault by all of them, they went to \"bulcao\" (balcony).  When they went there,the appellant went to his mother's room and brought a knife with which he stabbed Rauji.  At that time all the accused persons were in the balcony.  It was also alleged that after the deceased Rauji fell down on 4 the ground,Accused No. 3 kicked him.  At that time, the appellant who was holding the knife in his hand, handed over the same to Accused No. 3 by which she assaulted PW-8 but PW-8 caught the knife in her hand which caused injury to her right palm.  Thereafter, according to PW-1, Accused No. 3 handed back the knife to the appellant and Accused No. 2 brought the oil lamp which was hung in the room and hit the oil lamp on the head of Rauji, the deceased.  It was also alleged that when PW-8 tried to intervene, the other three accused started assaulting her with fists and slaps.  At that time, PW-2 came there and questioned the accused persons as to what they were doing, whereupon, the appellant and Accused no. 2 started assaulting PW-2 also.  Then, Accused No. 3 told the appellant and Accused No. 2 to finish off Rauji first.  PW-8, PW-18 and PW-1 then lifted Rauji and brought him in the courtyard.  In the meanwhile,residents of the locality had gathered in the courtyard and told the accused persons not to assault Rauji.  The juvenile offender, Sarita went inside the house and brought out one iron pipe which she handed over to the appellant who then hit the said pipe on the right leg of PW-1 and also gave a blow with the said pipe on Rauji's right hand.  It was also alleged that the other juvenile offender, Sharmila brought a cement block shaped like an elephant trunk, which she handed over to Accused No. 3 with which Accused No. 3 started assaulting Rauji.  PW-1, however, intervened and removed the said piece of cement block 5 from the hand of Accused No. 3 but, Accused No. 3 then picked up one stone and tried to throw it on Rauji by saying that she was going to kill him with that stone.  However, PW-1 again intervened and removed the said stone from the hand of Accused No.3. PW- 18 rushed to the rescue of deceased Rauji.  The accused then started assaulting her and PW-8 with slaps.  In the meantime, police jeep arrived at the scene and on seeing the police jeep, all the accused ran away from the courtyard and went inside.  PW - 1 and others asked the police to take Rauji to the Hospital whereupon the police took him to the hospital in the police jeep along with PW-1, PW - 2 and PW -8.  On the basis of complaint made by PW-1, an FIR was registered and the accused came to be arrested.", "statute": ["s3", "s1"]}, "2005.INSC.684.txt": {"doc_url": "http://www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/2005/684.html", "explanation": {"It is the appellant and his brother who started exchange of words by asking as to what they had been seeing.": ["s1"], "The appellant and his companions who were armed with weapons assaulted the deceased and the complainant who were unarmed and must have been taken by surprise.": ["s1"], "It may or may not be that both the deceased and the complainant were tripped into the gutter by the mischievous acts on the part of the appellant and his brother Ganpati, but the fact remains that they fell therein.": ["s1"], "They were not carrying any weapon whereas the accused were carrying deadly weapons.": ["s1"], "The effect of assault with deadly weapons on the vital part of the body of the deceased by the appellant must be considered in the aforementioned factual background.": ["s1"], "These stains are not mentioned in the panchanama.": ["s1"], "It is pertinent to note here that according to accused no.": ["s1"], "3 he had also fallen in the gutter and, therefore, the fact that all his clothes are covered with silt, is explained.": ["s1"], "These facts establish beyond doubt credibility of testimony of complainant and eye- witnesses, P.W.": ["s1"], "9 Raju Bavadekar and P.W.": ["s1"], "10 Shrirang @ Ranga Jadhav that the complainant and his brother Nandkumar had fallen in the gutter and they were assaulted in the gutter.": ["s1"], "\" The deceased and the complainant thus having fallen into the gutter were not in a position to defend themselves.": ["s1"], "The appellant herein did not restrain himself after inflicting one injury.": ["s1"], "He inflicted other and further injury also.": ["s1"], "The injuries, in view of the post mortem report, admittedly were more than one.": ["s1"], "\" In this case Exception 2 has no application as the Appellant cannot be said to have committed offence whilst deprived with the power of self- control by grave and sudden provocation, as has been noticed hereinbefore, that in the facts and circumstances of the case the deceased and the complainant cannot be said to have caused any provocation to the Appellant.": ["s1"], "In this view of the matter on scrutinizing the evidence of the four eyewitnesses PWs 2, 4, 7 and 8 who have depicted the entire scenario it is not possible for us to agree with the submission of Mr. Mishra, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the appellants that the case is one where Exception 4 to Section 300 would be applicable.": ["s1"], "Moreover, the manner in which the deceased and the complainant were assaulted show that the assailants took undue advantage of the situation as they fell into the gutter and were, thus, in a helpless condition.": ["s1"], "In this case, there was no provocation from the side of the deceased.": ["s1"], "He did not make even any causal remark which could provoke him nor the parties entered in altercations which culminated in the incident.": ["s1"], "The reported blows on the body of the deceased evidently were done with an intention to cause bodily injuries to him and such injuries were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, the offence would come within the purview of culpable homicide amounting to murder as envisaged under Section 300 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860.": ["s1"]}, "fact": " The parties were members of a joint family. Shamrao, accused no. 1 and Prahlad were two brothers. Whereas accused Nos. 2 to 5 belong to the branch of Shamrao; the deceased and the complainant were sons of Prahlad. A partition took place between the said brothers in 1984; whereby the northern portion of the open plot by the side of Haripur Road was allotted to the share of Prahlad and the southern one to Shamrao. The northern and southern portion of the plot is divided by a 15 ft. wide road. Indisputably the relationships between the parties were strained. All accused except accused no. 6 and the deceased as also the complainant, sons of Prahlad, are thus closely related. It is not in dispute that the complainant and his brothers had been bearing grudge against Shamrao and his sons inter alia on the ground of inequitable division of the joint family properties. Their residential houses of both parties were side by side . On the day of occurrence an almond tree was being planted in their side of open plot by the accused. Rajendra, PW8 and his brother Nandkumar, deceased were standing in their portion of the open plot allegedly waiting for their friends for going to participate in a game of Kabaddi to which accused nos. 2 and 3 asked them as to what they had been watching. They replied that they were standing on their own plot belonging to their father. The accused on that rushed towards them with weapons. accused no. 1 had an iron-rod, accused no. 2 had a knife, accused no. 3 was carrying a Pick-axe and accused no. 4 a shovel in their hand. Seeing accused persons advancing towards them the complainant and the deceased started retreading southwards, i.e. , towards plot of the accused. They fell in a gutter. Shamrao and Tanaji allegedly assaulted Rajendra whereas Nandkumar was assaulted by the appellant and Ganpati, accused no. 4 with the weapons in their hands. Rajendra tried to evade the assault on him by Shamrao with iron-rod as a result whereof he received injury on his back. A spade blow was given by Tanaji on his right foot. The appellant is said to have inflicted knife blows on Nandkumar, one on the chest below the left nipple and the other on the side near the arm-pit; whereas Ganpati is said to have inflicted blow on his stomach on the left side above hip bone by using pick-axe. The said incident is said to have been witnessed by Raju, P.W. 9 and Shrirang Jadhav, P.W. 10 who are friends of Rajendra and who were coming back from a temple. The accused thereafter ran away. Whereas the deceased was shifted to hospital in a Rickshaw, the complainant went to the Police Station alone in another Rickshaw It is not in dispute that Baburao Thorat P.W. 16, the P.S.O. received a phone call from Dr. Aphale informing that Nandkumar had been admitted to the hospital by his brother Arvind. The first information report lodged by Rajendra was recorded at 15 p.m. by Shri Thorat against the accused for commission of offences under Section 307 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. Shri Thorat again received a call soon thereafter from Dr. Aphale informing him that Nandkumar had died in the meanwhile. The genesis of the occurrence is not in dispute. The complainant and the deceased were watching plantation of an almond tree in their premises by the accused from their own land. They cannot be said to have caused any annoyance to them. It is the appellant and his brother who started exchange of words by asking as to what they had been seeing. The answer by the complainant to the effect that they had been standing on their own land cannot be said to be a cause for the accused being greatly provoked so as to cause bodily injuries on the deceased and the complainant. The appellant and his companions who were armed with weapons assaulted the deceased and the complainant who were unarmed and must have been taken by surprise. Conceivably appellant nos. 1, 3 and 4 were carrying iron rod, pick-axe and shovel respectively for the purpose of the plantation of the tree, but the knife, which was the weapon of offence and was being carried by the appellant herein, was not required for the said purpose. Why he was carrying such a big knife remains unexplained. Accused no. 1 and 4 as well as the appellant advanced towards the deceased and the complainant as a result whereof they went near the gutter which was just by the side of the land of the accused. It may or may not be that both the deceased and the complainant were tripped into the gutter by the mischievous acts on the part of the appellant and his brother Ganpati, but the fact remains that they fell therein. The complainant and the deceased were assaulted in the gutter itself. They were not carrying any weapon whereas the accused were carrying deadly weapons. The effect of assault with deadly weapons on the vital part of the body of the deceased by the appellant must be considered in the aforementioned factual background. The garments put on by the deceased and the complainant as also the appellant were seized. The learned trial Judge held that: \"It is also not in dispute that the none of the accused has sustained any injury and, therefore, the fact that arrest panchanama is not prepared, does not show that there is manipulation on the part of the I.O. clothes, of these accused are attached under panchanama Ex This panchanama is duly proved by P.W. 6 Chandrakant Babar. Panchanama shows that Dhoti and Shirt of Shamrao were stained with blood. There were blood stains on the waist-band and pant of accused no. 2 Subhash, and the Bandi and under-pant of accused no. 3 Ganpati were soiled with silt. There were blood stains on the pant of Tanaji. I have seen these garments at the time of arguments. It is found that silt was on the sleeve of shirt near the cuff, of accused no. 2 Subhash. These stains are not mentioned in the panchanama. There was silt on all the garments of accused no. 3 Ganapati. There were mud stains on the pant, article no. 22, of accused no. 4 Tanaji. It is pertinent to note here that according to accused no. 3 he had also fallen in the gutter and, therefore, the fact that all his clothes are covered with silt, is explained. These facts establish beyond doubt credibility of testimony of complainant and eye- witnesses, P.W. 9 Raju Bavadekar and P.W. 10 Shrirang @ Ranga Jadhav that the complainant and his brother Nandkumar had fallen in the gutter and they were assaulted in the gutter. \" The deceased and the complainant thus having fallen into the gutter were not in a position to defend themselves. At this juncture, we may notice the ante mortem injuries found on the body of the deceased Nandkumar. The doctor who examined the deceased stated: \"When I examined the patient, I found that the patient was conscious. His general condition was poor. There was severe pallor. Pulse 110 per minute. Respiratory rate 40 per minute. B.P. 80 to 60 Hg. Patient gave history of assault at 7 p.m. with knife. \" The post mortem was also conducted by him. The doctor further opined: \"At the time of post-mortem, I observed that the clothes of the deceased were wet with dirty water. I have described external injuries in column no. I have also observed at the time of post-mortem that there was mark of blood over chest, abdomen, legs hands mixed with dirty water stains. These observations are mentioned in column no. 14 of post-mortem notes. \" He further stated that : \"Contents of the post-mortem notes are correct. Post mortem notes are marked as Exh. All these injuries were ante-mortem. Injury no. 1 in col. no. 17 corresponds to finding in col. no. 29(e) i.e. injury to left lung. Injury no. 4 is surgical. Injury no. 2 corresponds to internal injury described in col. no. 21 showing that large intestine was punctured. The blood seen in the peritoneam might on account of injury no.3 described in column no. Standing of pleura with blood is on account injury no. Inj. Nos. 1 to 3 and 5 can be caused by hard and sharp weapon. article no. 31-knife shown to witnesections Injury no. 1, 2 and 5 can be caused by this knife. Injury no. 5 can be caused while making efforts to ward off the blow. Pick-axe (Art. no. 5) shown to witnesections Injury no. 3 can be caused by pointed end of the pick-axe. \" In his opinion, the injury no. 1 by itself was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death. Injury no. 2 and 3 can also cause death but in that case the death will not be immediate. Those injuries however would not be sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death as there could be chances of survival as well as of death. It was explained by him that in his injury report he opined that injury no. 2 was muscle deep; at that time he did not probe the injury. In his cross- examination, the doctor further stated that: \"The direction of injury no. 1 is medial upto the thylum of lung (root of lung). Direction of injury no. 2 is downwards. Direction of injury no. 3 is medial. It is correct to say that would cause by pick-axe (Article no. 5) will have lacerations on the edges of the wound. I have not noted these lacerations while describing injury no. It is correct to say that the weapon must enter upto intestine for 6 inches for causing a puncture The depth of this injury no. 3 is about 6 inches. Now says, I cannot definitely say that inj. no. 3 can be caused by Article no. 5. Considering the fact that the weapons pierced the body of 6 inches. It is a fact that I have described inj. no. 2 in M.L.C. register as muscle deep. This is so because at that time I did not probe the injury. \" The injury no. 1 therefore went right upto the right of the lung. The appellant herein did not restrain himself after inflicting one injury. He inflicted other and further injury also. The injuries, in view of the post mortem report, admittedly were more than one. \" In this case Exception 2 has no application as the Appellant cannot be said to have committed offence whilst deprived with the power of self- control by grave and sudden provocation, as has been noticed hereinbefore, that in the facts and circumstances of the case the deceased and the complainant cannot be said to have caused any provocation to the Appellant. From the evidence on record it is established that while the prosecution party was on their land it is the accused who protested and prevented them from continuing with ploughing but when they did not stop the accused persons rushed to the nearby plot which is their land and got weapons in their hands and assaulted the prosecution party ultimately injuring several members of the prosecution party and causing the death of one of them while they were fully unarmed. In this view of the matter on scrutinizing the evidence of the four eyewitnesses PWs 2, 4, 7 and 8 who have depicted the entire scenario it is not possible for us to agree with the submission of Mr. Mishra, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the appellants that the case is one where Exception 4 to Section 300 would be applicable. We, therefore, reject the said submission of the learned counsel. Moreover, the manner in which the deceased and the complainant were assaulted show that the assailants took undue advantage of the situation as they fell into the gutter and were, thus, in a helpless condition. In this case, there was no provocation from the side of the deceased. He did not make even any causal remark which could provoke him nor the parties entered in altercations which culminated in the incident. The reported blows on the body of the deceased evidently were done with an intention to cause bodily injuries to him and such injuries were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, the offence would come within the purview of culpable homicide amounting to murder as envisaged under Section 300 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860.", "statute": ["s1"]}, "2008.INSC.1611.txt": {"doc_url": "http://www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/2008/1611.html", "explanation": {", the deceased along with some of the witnesses was sitting outside their houses when all the accused armed with clubs and sickles came there and assaulted Balappa Naik and when those sitting there, that is, his mother, sister, brothers and uncle intervened, they too were assaulted and caused various injuries.": ["s1"]}, "fact": " One B.K.Naik had two brothers - Rekhya Naik and Ganga Naik PW Balappa Naik, the deceased, PW3 Veeraya Naik, PW 7 Naga Naik and PW9 Shantamma are the children of B.K.Naik and Jamballama, PW Shankaramma PW24 was the wife of the deceased.

On opening the door by Sanjay Kedare (P.W.9), accused Khandu informed Sanjay that his brother Vijay had been assaulted and was lying at some place. Sanjay thereupon accompanied Khandu who took him to the top floor of Bharti Lodge, where Sanjay found his brother Vijay in injured condition tied to the cot with his hands and legs tied. Sanjay also saw some blood oozing out from the head of Vijay. Sanjay released the hands and legs of Vijay and asked him as to how it had happened, whereupon he was told by Vijay that all the six accused after tying him to the cot, assaulted him severely with instruments like iron pipe and wooden stick on the allegation that he had stolen a bicycle. Sanjay thereupon carried Vijay to his residence and Vijay once again narrated the said incident to his mother in the presence of Sanjay and from there, he was taken in a rickshaw to the Civil Hospital, Nasik. On the way to the hospital, Vijay became unconscious and on being admitted to the hospital, he was declared to have been dead. The body of the deceased Vijay was subjected to the inquest panchnama as well as post mortem examination. The medical officer opined that the death of Vijay was due to shock, intracranial hemorrhage and due to fracture of skull. After carrying out the spot panchnama, the articles at the spot of the incident including the blood scrapping were collected from the scene of offence. The iron pipe was recovered at the instance of the accused no.1 Sham Kankaria, Coir Cord and pieces of wooden pegs having blood stains were seized from the spot of the incident. The seized articles were sent for examination by the Chemical Analyser. The blood sample of the deceased was also collected and sent for medical analysis along with the clothes on the body of the deceased. On conclusion of the investigation, all the six accused were charge-sheeted. If after careful scrutiny the Court is satisfied that it is true and free from any effort to induce the deceased to make a false statement and if it is coherent and consistent, there shall be no legal impediment to make it basis of conviction, even if there is no corroboration. On the contrary, the same appears to have been made by the deceased voluntarily. It is trustworthy and has credibility. Criticism that PWs 9 and 10 being relatives have falsely implicated the accused persons needs rejection for the simple reasons that no material has been brought on record to show as to why they would falsely implicate the accused and shield actual culprit. Judged in the background and the principle set out above, the inevitable conclusion is that the prosecution has clearly established that the vital blow was given by the accused no.1 Sham Shankar Kankaria. There is no material to show that the accused persons shared common object of causing any injury to the deceased or to cause his death. It is the prosecution case that the accused persons wanted to extract a confession from the deceased of his having committed theft of a cycle.

Ganpat and his sons belonged to the group of one Adhikrao Kadam and had canvassed against Sambhaji (accused no. 2) and his group in the Gram Panchayat Elections. Though A2 got elected, his group has defeated. Further Ganpat allegedly refused to transfer three Guntas of land in the village belonging to his family, as demanded by A2 Sambhaji. Consequently A2 and his supporters had a grudge against Ganpat and his family. A2 Sambhaji, as Chairman of the local co- operative society had withheld the issue of 'no-due' certificate to Ganpat and caused hardship to him. Prabhakar (accused no. 1 who died during the pendency of appeal) and Mohan (Accused no.4) were brothers of Sambhaji (Accused no.2). Appasaheb (Accused no.3) was the cousin, and Prahalad and Mahadev (Accused Nos. 6 and 7) were the friends of Sambhaji. Shankar (Accused no.5) was the servant of A1 Prabhakar. All the accused were also residents of the same village. There was simmering differences between the two groups. 2) At about 8 P.M. on 1988, Ganpat's son Shivaji was assaulted by the accused by catching hold of him and tearing his Banian near Jotiba temple. Putlabai, mother of Shivaji, rushed from her house which was nearby and took Shivaji back home. That night at about 10 P.M, when Shivaji and other family members were inside the house, A6 Prahlad called Shivaji to come out. When Shivaji came into the courtyard in front of the house, the accused armed with sword, axes, sticks and stones assaulted Shivaji. Shivaji's parents Ganpat and Putlabai and Ananda came out of the house, one after the other. They were also assaulted by the accused and were injured. Lastly, Vilas another son of Ganpat, came home, when the others were being attacked, and he was also assaulted by the accused. By then Adhikrao Kadam (for whom Ganpat's family worked during the Gram Panchayat Elections) came in his Jeep. Seeing him, all the accused ran away. Adhikrao Kadam took Ganpat and his son Vilas, who were injured to Krishna Hospital at Karad where they were treated around 00 P.M. 3) On being informed about the fight in Kusur village and two injured being admitted to the hospital, the I.O. (V.G.Chougule, PSI - PW17) went to the hospital accompanied by police staff. He recorded the statement of Vilas (FIR - exhibit71) at about 1 A.M. on 1988 to the effect that when he reached home, he saw a crowd in front of his house and learnt from them that there was a dispute between A1, A2 and A3 with his father Ganpat; that when he was entering the house, A1 gave him two blows with a sword, and A2 hit him with a stick and he fell unconscious; and that he and his father were brought to the Hospital for treatment. On the basis of the said FIR, CR no.150/1988 was registered in the Karad Taluk Police Station. 4) Immediately thereafter, the IO went to Kusur village (around 30 A.M. on the morning of 1988). He did not find anyone in the house of Ganpat. The accused were also not traced. He returned to the police station around 30 A.M. By then Ganpat's another son Ananda reached the police station. The IO again went back to the Kusur village with Ananda and drew spot panchanama (Ex.33), under which blood stained stick and earth smeared with blood and some blood stained stones were recovered from the place of incident. While drawing the spot panchnama, the dead body of Shivaji was found in the bathroom in the cattle shed in front of the house. Inquest panchanama was recorded as per exhibit The dead body was sent for post mortem through constable More (PW16). Thereafter, the statements of Ganpat, Putlabai, and Ananda (PWs, 12, 13 and 14) were recorded. During the search, IO found one bamboo stick in front of the house of A1 which was seized under Panchnama exhibit 35 in the presence of PW 3 & 4. The blood-stained clothes of PW12 Ganpat and PW9 Vilas were seized under seizure panchanama Exs.23 and 5) In regard to the earlier incident near Jotiba temple that occurred at 8 P.M, Shivaji More, brother of A6 had lodged a complaint with Kole outpost on 1988 itself, alleging that Ganpat and his sons namely Vilas, Ananda and Shivaji along with others had caused rioting and assaulted him and his brother Tanaji More. The said complaint was passed on to Karad Police Station and registered as CR no.151/ 6) On 1988, A2 Samabhaji and A3 Appasaheb were arrested in village Tulsan. Accused 5, 6 and 7 (Shankar, Prahlad and Mahadeo) surrendered on Accused 1 and 4 (Prabhakar and Mohan) had secured anticipatory bail and they were formally shown as arrested on 1988 and 1988 respectively. 7) On 1988, Sambhaji (A2) offered to give a statement. IO called PW5 and PW6 as witnesses. In their presence A2 made a statement (Memorandum recorded as exhibit37) stating that he had concealed an axe and sword under a Tamarind tree. A2 led the IO and PWs. 5 and 6 to that place and the axe and sword were recovered and seized under Panchnama exhibit37A. Shankar (A5) volunteered on 1988 to give a statement. IO called PWs. 7 and 8 as witnesses. In their presence A5 stated that he had concealed an axe and stick in the bamboo shrubs and offered to produce the same and his statement was recorded as per exhibit A5 led the IO and PWs 7 and 8 to the place where they were hidden and the axe and stick were recovered and seized under Panchanama exhibit40A. 3. 1) Vilas, brother of the deceased Shivaji, examined as PW9 did not say anything at all about the attack on Shivaji. 2) Ganpat (PW12), father of deceased Shivaji stated in his examination in chief that when Shivaji came into the courtyard all the accused rushed towards him; that accused A1 Prabhakar assaulted him with a sword on his head; thereafter A5 Shankar and A4 Mohan assaulted him with axes; and at the same time, A2 Sambhaji and A3 Appaso also assaulted him with sticks and stones. Thus in examination in chief Ganpat assigns specific roles to each of A1 to A5 in the attack on Shivaji. In his cross examination he admitted that when he made the statement to the Police on 1988, he did not say that A4 Mohan had assaulted Shivaji. He further admitted that in his statement recorded by the police on 1988, there is no reference to A2, A3, A4 and A5 assaulting Shivaji. He claimed that though he had mentioned to the police that A5 Shankar had assaulted Shivaji with an axe and that A2 and A3 had assaulted Shivaji with sticks and stones, those statements were not recorded by the police. But the IO (PW17) stated : \"In his statement PW12 Ganpat before me dated 1988, did not state that accused no. 5 Shankar and accused no. 7 Mahadeo were amongst assailants of Shivaji himself and other. PW12 Ganpat also did not state before me in his statement dated 1988 that accused no. 5 Shankar assaulted Shivaji with axe or by any other weapon. He also did not state before me that accused no.2 Sambhaji and accused no.3 Appasaheb assaulted deceased Shivaji with stick and stone. \" The evidence of Ganpat about A2 to A5 attacking Shivaji with axes, sticks and stones is thus clearly an afterthought and improvement at the stage of evidence, to falsely implicate A2 to A 3) Putlabai (PW13) mother of Shivaji stated in her examination-in-chief that A1 Prabhakar assaulted Shivaji with a sword, and A5 Shankar and A6 Prahlad assaulted Shivaji with axe. (But her son Ananda (PW4) has clearly stated in his examination-in-chief that A6 Prahlad was unarmed). But in her cross examination she says that when she came out of the house, she saw her son Shivaji running towards the bathroom in the cattle shed and did not return from bathroom. If by the time she came out of the house, Shivaji was already running towards the bathroom and did not return thereafter, it is obvious that she did not see who assaulted Shivaji and with what weapons. 4) Ananda, another brother of Shivaji, in his examination-in-chief made a general statement that his brother Shivaji was attacked by all the accused persons with the weapons with which they were armed. He stated that A1 was armed with a sword, A4 and A5 with axes, A2 and A3 with sticks but A6 and A7 were unarmed. In the cross examination he stated that all his family members were inside the house, that Shivaji went out first, thereafter his father went out, thereafter his mother went out and he came out last, and when he came out into the courtyard he saw his brother Shivaji running towards the bathroom. Obviously therefore he also did not see who assaulted Shivaji, as by the time he came out of the house, Shivaji was already running towards the bathroom. 5) Thus except Ganpat (PW12), none saw any of the accused attacking Shivaji. PW9 did not see anything; PW13 and PW14 could not have witnessed the attack on Shivaji as according to them, they only saw him running towards the bathroom. Ganpat who is the only person who could have witnessed the attack on Shivaji, says that A1 attacked Shivaji with a sword, both in his statement on 1988 and in his evidence. In regard to A2 to A5 apparently he did not say anything to police when his statement was recorded on 1988 but assigned them roles in the attack on Shivaji when he was examined in court. An analysis of the entire evidence thus shows there is only one eye-witness (PW12) in regard to the attack on Shivaji and his evidence is only of A1 attacking Shivaji and there is no evidence of any of the other accused assaulting Shivaji. We may next refer to several strange circumstances in regard to the death of Shivaji and discovery of his body. 1) The first circumstances is about the altercation between Shivaji and a crowd at about 8 p.m. on 1988 near the Jotiba temple (situated at a distance of 10 yards from Ganpat's house). Putlabai says that at about 8 p.m. Shivaji left the house to go towards the shop, that immediately thereafter she heard a hue and cry and came out of the house, that she saw a crowd of many persons (including one Shivaji More and Tanaji More) had gathered near the Jotiba temple and her son Shivaji was standing with his Banian torn and that she advised him not to quarrel and brought him back to the house. Ganpat admits that in regard to the said incident at 8 p.m. Shivaji More and Tanaji More (brother of A6) had filed a complaint alleging that Shivaji and his brothers along with others had assaulted them on 1988 at 8 p.m. near Jotiba temple. Therefore it is evident that at about 8 p.m. , a huge unnamed crowd (including one Shivaji More and Tanaji More) had assembled near the Jotiba temple and in a fight Shivaji's banian was torn and in regard to that incident, Shivaji More and Tanaji More had complained that Shivaji along with his brothers and others had assaulted them. Though in her examination in chief Putlabai stated that A1, A3, A5 and A6 caught hold of Shivaji at about 8 p.m. and tore his banian, in the cross examination she admits that when she heard a hue and cry and went out of the house towards the temple she saw her son Shivaji standing there with banian torn and she brought him back. It is thus evident that she did not witness A1, A3, A5 and A6 or anyone else catching hold of Shivaji or tearing his banian at 8 pm. The reason why a crowd had assembled near the temple near Ganpat's house and what was the quarrel in which Shivaji's banian was torn, remains unexplained. None of the prosecution witnesses has given the reason for a hostile crowd standing at 8 pm near the Jotiba temple and Shivaji being assaulted and his banian being torn. There is also a further reference to the crowd assembling near Ganpat's house at 10 P.M. Putlabai (PW13), Ananda (PW14) and DW1 (Kalawati) refer to a mob of villagers coming near Ganpat's house just before the incident (around 10 p.m. ) and stones being thrown at Ganpat's house. The prosecution has not explained why the village crowd was furious with Ganpat and his family, why they threw stones at Ganpat's house and who were the members of the village crowd. DW1, however, categorically stated that none of the accused were part of the crowd/mob that threw stones at Ganpat's house. 2) The next is the strange behaviour of Ganpat and his family. Putlabai (PW13) stated that her son Shivaji returned home at 8 P.M. after taking his meal in his friend's house, that he left thereafter to go to his shop, she heard a hue and cry, went out and found Shivaji near Jotiba Temple with his Banian torn, tells him not to quarrel and brings him back to home and confined him in a room so as to prevent him from going out again and bolted the door of the house. Ganpat (PW12) stated that on 1988 he returned home at about 8 P.M, saw the accused standing in front of his house and suspected danger, so made his escape and went to his house by another way. (But he admitted that there is only one entrance to the house in the front of the house. If the accused were standing in front of the house, there was no question of his coming by another way. Be that as it may). He also stated that when he entered his house all the accused were present in the courtyard and none assaulted him when he was entering the house. Ganpat further stated that when he entered the house, he saw that all his family members were frightened and his son Shivaji told him that the accused had assaulted him at 5 to 6 P.M. on that day. Ganpat then stated : \"Myself, my son and my family members were sitting in the house by bolting the door from inside, after I came from village. As Prahlad More (Accused no.6) called deceased outside, he (Shivaji) came out of the house. I did not advice Shivaji not to go out of the house. \" But Putlabai on the other hand says : \"Myself, my husband, Shivaji and Ananda were in the house prior to Starting of the incident. It is true that at that time so many persons from our village rushed in crowd towards our house showering the stones at the directions of our house. Hearing the hue and cry of this crowd, Shivaji came out of the room and went outside. \" If Shivaji had already been attacked, if the family was frightened, if the mob was throwing stones, if they had bolted the door and were remaining inside, one would expect Ganpat and Putlabai to prevent their son Shivaji from going out or at least ask him to stay inside. But they did not. We refer to his aspect only to show that the conduct was not natural or that the events did not happen in the manner put forth by the prosecution. 3) The next strange circumstance is the non-discovery of Shivaji's body for more than 8 hours after his death. According to the prosecution case the attack on Shivaji resulting in his death occurred at about 10 pm on Ganpat, Putlabai and Ananda stated in their examination that they saw Shivaji being assaulted by some of the accused at about 10 p.m. But the cross examination of the witnesses demonstrates that neither Putlabai nor Ananda in fact saw any of the accused assaulting Shivaji and that only Ganpat apparently saw what happened. Both Putlabai and Ananda stated that when they came out of the house they saw Shivaji running towards the bathroom near the cattle shed. (The incident allegedly occurred in the front courtyard of Ganpat's house and the cattleshed and bathroom adjoined the front courtyard and the distance is hardly a few feet). But Ganpat states in the examination in chief that when accused attacked Shivaji, \"Shivaji fell down\" and \"Shivaji met with death instantaneously\". In his cross examination, he said \"Shivaji died on the scene of offence itself. I saw the incident by standing in the courtyard of my house. \" This contradicts the evidence of his wife and his son Ananda that Shivaji on being assaulted, ran towards the bathroom. Ganpat says that after Shivaji fell down, he (Ganpat) was attacked, his wife and son Ananda were attacked and in the meanwhile Adhikrao Kadam arrived in a jeep and seeing him all the accused escaped from the place. He further states that he along with his son Vilas were taken by Adhikrao Kadam to Krishna hospital Karad for treatment. He also says that when going to the hospital, he asked his wife Putlabai and son Ananda to stay back at home. Therefore when Ganpat and Vilas left for the hospital, Shivaji was lying in the courtyard, obviously in coma or dead. He was not taken to hospital. When the IO came about 3 hours later at about 30 a.m. on 1988, the body was not in the courtyard. Who took Shivaji's body to the bathroom? Why was Shivaji's death or his being injured was not informed to police? The IO apparently did not search the entire house (at 30 A.M. on 1988) as no one informed him about Shivaji being dead or injured. Even when Ananda went to the Police Station at 30 a.m. on 1988, he did he not inform about Shivaji being dead or injured. Even when IO returned to the scene of crime around 6 A.M. (as per the evidence of PW14) neither Ananda nor IO searched for Shivaji. The IO found the body only when he went round for drawing the spot panchnama. Why the delay of 8 hours in discovering the body of Shivaji (10 A.M. on 1988 to 6 A.M. on 1988) when his body was obviously in the courtyard of the house? These questions have not been answered. It is not only strange but virtually impossible to believe that the body of Shivaji would have remained unattended and unchecked till next day morning in the background of what had happened. 4) The next strange circumstance is why nobody bothered about Shivaji. The natural and instinctive reaction of any parents or brothers would have been to take Shivaji to a hospital and get him treated. But Shivaji was lying in the courtyard itself (according to Ganpat) or went towards the bathroom (according to Putlabai and Ananda). None bothered to verify whether he was dead or alive, nor make any attempt to take him to the hospital for treatment. Ananda who met the IO (at 30 A.M. on 1988) did not inform him that Shivaji was assaulted and he was injured. If really the incident had occurred in the manner narrated by these witnesses and Shivaji was seriously injured it is strange that no one bothered about Shivaji. It was not as if there was any other way to go out of the house through the cattle shed or bathroom and that Shivaji could have gone out that way. Ganpat has clearly admitted that except the main entrance there are no doors to go out of the house. If Ganpat, Putlabai and Ananda were aware that Shivaji was attacked and injured in the manner stated in their evidence and he was lying either in the front courtyard or in the bathroom, the first natural action would have been to find out his condition and give him treatment. It was not done. When Adhikrao Kadam came to the spot in a jeep within a few minutes of the attack on Shivaji, Ganpat made no effort to take Shivaji to hospital. Even Putlabai and Ananda who remained in the house, did not verify what happened to him. When the IO came around 30 pm in the early morning of 1988 he did not find the body of Shivaji nor did he find Putlabai and Ananda at home. But when Investigating Officer returned around 6 pm on 1988 along with Ananda and while drawing the spot panchnama, he found the dead body of Shivaji mysteriously lying in the bathroom. The postmortem report and the evidence of Dr. Solanki (PW11) who conducted the postmortem shows that the cause of death was \"coma and death due to skull injury with heart injury. \" As per the postmortem report, the death was within two hours from taking the last meal and Putlabai says that the last meal was taken by Shivaji before 8 pm. Therefore it is evident that Shivaji did not go out after the injuries or come back later to die in the bathroom. He died around 10 p.m. which was when the incident occurred. But if the statement of Putlabai and Ananda that they had seen Shivaji running towards the bathroom was true, does it mean that he was not seriously injured then? Significantlt Putlabai stated in her cross-examination that she came to know that Shivaji received cut injuries only when his body was taken out from the bathroom on 19th morning after 00 a.m. This makes it clear that on 1988 when Ganpat and family members were injured, she did not even know that Shivaji had been injured. It is also possible that Ganpat and Ananda were also not aware that he was injured or that he died, when Adhikrao Kadam came to the spot. Or it is possible that after Adhikrao Kadam left with Ganpat and Vilas for treatment, Shivaji was injured by someone else. That may explain why Ganpat, Putlabai and Ananda were unconcerned about Shivaji. The alternatives are too many and there are no satisfactory answers. In this connection, one significant discrepancy in the evidence of Ganpat and Ananda requires to be noticed. Ganpat specifically states that after the incident when he left the house with Adhikrao Kadam for the hospital, Ananda was at home and he asked him to remain at home. This is reiterated by Putlabai also. But Ananda says that when he was attacked, he ran away and was not present when Adhikrao Kadam reached the spot. We extract below the relevant evidence of Ganpat, Putlabai and Ananda. Ganpat stated : \"Putlabai and my son Ananda also came out of the house. They were also assaulted by the accused persons. Meanwhile one Jeep vehicle of one Adhikrao kadam arrived there and seeing so all the accused made their escape. I asked my wife and my son Ananda to remain in the house and myself, Adhikrao and PW9 Vilas went Krishna Hospital in Jeep of Adhikrao\". Putlabai confirmed the above by stating that 'my husband and my son Vilas went to hospital at Karad after the incident. However, myself and my son Ananda remained in the house. ' On the other hand, Ananda stated : \"A5 Shankar assaulted me with axe with its but end on my head A2 Sambhaji and A3 Apasaheb assaulted with stick blows to Vilas on his back and stomach. Thereafter, I went running towards harijan Basti of our village. Thereafter, I went near Karad Dhebewadi Road at Kole village shop and thereafter, I went to Gharewati. I boarded in a truck and came to Karad Taluka Police Station at about 4 to 30 A.M. \" The prosecution case if accepted would mean that Ganpat, a father left injured Shivaji unattended in the courtyard even without verifying whether he was dead or alive. It is not only the father, but also mother and brother who did not bother about Shivaji and left him unattended. This is not a natural reaction. 5) The next strange circumstance is the non-examination of Adhikrao Kadam or any neighbour of Ganpat. Ganpat and his family worked for Adhikrao Kadam in the Panchayat election and against A2 Sambhaji. Thus it is obvious that Adhikrao was the leader or important member of the group to which Ganpat and family belonged, which was fighting against A2's group. There was an attack by a mob at 8 p.m. against Shivaji and again an attack by the mob by throwing stones at Ganpat's house at 10 pm. PW13 Putlabai stated in her evidence that 'many persons from our village rushed in a crowd towards our house throwing stones in the direction of the house'. This is reiterated by PW14 Ananda who stated that 'some persons threw stones at our house'. Why was the stone throwing by the villagers, is not explained. But Adhikrao Kadam appears in his jeep around 10 p.m. when the attack against Ganpat's family was going on. According to Ganpat, when Adhikrao Kadam came, the persons attacking his family ran away. Why would the attackers run away? Whether he was alone in the Jeep or he came with a group is not mentioned. But it is stated that the moment he came in his jeep, all the seven accused ran away. The crowd also disappeared. Adhikrao must have witnessed the accused running away. Did he see Shivaji lying in the courtyard? He took Ganpat and Vilas to hospital. He knew whether Ganpat and Vilas were conscious or not. He would have been the ideal witness to answer several questions which have remained unanswered. But strangely he is not examined. In fact the IO does not even refer to recording his statement during the investigation. The IO however stated that during investigation, he recorded the statements of three neighbours of Ganpat, namely Kalawati, Yasoda and Vasala but none of them were examined by the prosecution. On the other hand, the defence examined one of them namely Kalawati who stated that many persons came near the house of Ganpat and threw stones that there was a scuffle between the crowd and Ganpat and his family members. She also stated none of the accused formed part of the said crowd which attacked Ganpat and his family. She also stated that she saw that Ganpat and Villas sustained injuries, that Putalabai and Ananda did not receive any injuries and that she did not see Shivaji in that scuffle and that while Vilas and Ganpat were shifted to a hospital in the jeep of Adhikrao Kadam, Putlabai and Ananda remained in the house. It is in this background of material inconsistencies, large gaps and prosecution's failure to explain several relevant aspects, the trial court after an exhaustive consideration of the evidence found that the evidence of PWs.12, 13 and 14 was not reliable; that Vilas PW9 who was the informant, had denied any knowledge of having stated that the accused had attacked Shivaji; that except the three interested witnesses who also happen to be the closest relatives of the deceased namely parents and brother, no one else has spoken about the incident. On the other hand the defence examined DW1 a neighbour of Ganpat, who stated that none of the accused formed part of the crowd that assembled in front of the house of Ganpat throwing stones. Even if her evidence is discounted, the several strange unexplained circumstances referred to above, cannot be brushed aside either as minor inconsistencies or omissions in evidence. The evidence clearly shows that an attempt has been made by PWs. 9, 12, 13 and 14 to implicate all the accused or at least accused 2 to 6 for the death of Shivaji and attack on PW 9,12,13 & 14 on account of previous enmity. It is also evident that Vilas got cold feet, did not go along with family and denied any knowledge when he was examined in court. On the facts and circumstances, there was absolutely no justification for the High Court to interfere with the decision of the trial court. The learned counsel for appellants drew our attention to several other inconsistencies in the evidence of PWs. 9, 12, 13 and As they are minor, we do not propose to examine them. 10. Ganpat (PW 12) did not say in his evidence that he became unconscious when he was attacked. In his examination in chief he stated that Shivaji fell down on being assaulted; he, his wife and son Ananda were assaulted; that in the meanwhile the jeep of Adhikrao Kadam came and the accused escaped and he was taken in the jeep to Krishna hospital. Ganpat stated in his cross examination that \"I asked my wife and my son Ananda to remain in the house and myself, Adhikrao Kadam and Vilas went out to Krishna hospital in the jeep of Adhikrao Kadam. \" Thus he was fully in his senses all along and was never unconscious. Even the hospital records support this fact. The physical examination report forming part of the hospital records (marked exhibit P67) and the injury certificate (Ex. P68) show Ganpat was examined on 1988 at about 11 P.M. for \"alleged stab injuries inflicted by sword\" and the patient was conscious. Except the oral testimony of PWs.12, 13 and 14 which stands rejected the only other evidence that is relied on to link the accused to the incident is the alleged disclosure statements made by A2 and A5 leading to recovery of the some weapons used in the attack. It is claimed that in a statement alleged to have been made by A2 Sambhaji in the presence of panch witnesses PW5 (N. section Pisal) and PW6 (A.T Dange), he admitted having concealed the axe and a sword under a tamarind tree and the said axe and sword were recovered by the police in the presence of these Panch witnesses. The memorandum of the alleged statement of A2 recorded by the IO is exhibit 37 and the panchnama regarding recovery is at P37A. Both PW5 and PW6, the alleged panch witnesses turned hostile and stated in their evidence that they did not know A2 Sambhaji; that A2 did not give any statement before them to the police; that Sambhaji was not even present at the police station nor did he lead them to any spot, nor any sword or axe recovered. They denied the contents of the panchnama and stated that even though they protested to police that they would not sign a false panchnama, the police threatened and obtained their signatures to the memorandum of statement and panchnama. Similarly the prosecution alleged that A5 Shankar made a statement in the presence of panch witnesses PWs.7 and 8 (S. J. More ad M. H. More) that he had kept concealed an axe and a sword beneath bamboo shrubs and that he took them to that place and the said articles were recovered in the presence of the said Panch witnesses; the statement of A5 was recorded in the form of a memorandum (Ex. 40) and the articles recovered from the place of concealment by A5 were seized under panchnama (Ex. P-40A). But PW7 and PW8 turned hostile and stated that they did not know A5 and he did not make any statement before them, that he did not lead them to any place, nor was the axe and bamboo stick recovered and seized by the police in their presence. They stated that they had signed exhibit40 and 40A at the instance of police. Therefore the entire evidence regarding recovery of weapons at the instance of the accused 2 and 5 will have to be rejected. Similarly, the recovery of a stick in front of the house of A1 is also not proved as the panch witnesses (PWs. 3 & 4 - sectionL. Deshmukh and P.D. Marathe) denied such recovery. 1) Insofar as Vilas (PW9) is concerned, we have noticed that in the statement to the police (FIR) Vilas is alleged to have stated that A1 gave two blows with a sword on his hand and head and A2 hit him with a stick. But in his examination-in-chief he stated that as he neared his house, someone hit him on his head and he fell on the ground unconscious and regained consciousness only in the Krishna hospital. He was treated as hostile and cross examined by the PP. He clearly denied the suggestion that A1 come behind him and gave a blow of sword on his head and right hand, as also the suggestion that A2 gave him a stick blow. He also stated that he did not make statement to the police, naming the accused. 2) The evidence of Putlabai (PW13) about the attack on her is very short. In examination chief she stated that 'A5 Shankar Jadhav assaulted me near right eye with an axe and I received injury on that part. ' In cross examination she stated 'someone hit me near my right eye with an axe and I received injury and I fell unconscious. ' Her husand Ganpat stated that his wife Putlabai was assaulted by accused but does not name anyone. He admitted that he did not tell the police as to who assaulted his wife when his statement was recorded. On the other hand PW14 Ananda stated that when his mother Putlabai come out of the house A4 Mohan assaulted his mother near her right eye. Thus as far as the attack on Putlabai is concerned, PW9 Vilas does not say anything. PW12 Ganpat does not say who assaulted her, Putlabai herself says that A5 Shankar assaulted her near the eye with an axe but in cross examination says \"someone\" assaulted her with an axe near her eye, and her son Ananda says that A4 Mohan assaulted her with an axe near the eye. Therefore it is clear that the evidence as to who caused injury to Putlabai is also wholly unreliable. 3) Ananda PW14 stated in his examination in chief that A5 Shankar assaulted him by giving an axe blow (with butt's end). Ganpat said he did not see who attacked his son Ananda. Putlabai says in her evidence that her son Ananda was attacked by A6 Pralhad. Thus there is a clear variation as to who attacked Ananda. While Ananda says that he was attacked by A5 Shankar with an axe, his mother says that Ananda was attacked with an axe by A6 Pralhad. Thus here again the evidence in regard to as to who attacked Ananda, is also totally unreliable. 4) Ganpat stated in his examination in chief that A1 Prabhakar gave a sword blow on his head and another blow on his right cheek. His wife Putlabai also says A1 assaulted her husband with sword. Ganpat said that A4 Mohan and A5 Shankar gave him axe blows, but his wife Putlabai says A5 Shankar and A6 Pralhad assaulted her husband with axes. On the other hand Ananda PW14 says that Pralhad A6 was unarmed and A1 Prabhakar assaulted his father. Therefore the only evidence without any contradiction is about A1 attacking Ganpat with a sword. There is no reliable evidence about A4 or A5 or A6 or any other accused assaulting Ganpat. In other words, as far as A2 to A6 are concerned, there is absolutely no reliable evidence to show that they assaulted or caused injuries to either the deceased Shivaji or any of his family members namely PWs.9, 12, 13 and There is no acceptable evidence that all or any of them with common intent assaulted Shivaji or his family members. Their presence at the site of incident is doubtful.", "statute": ["s1"]}}
