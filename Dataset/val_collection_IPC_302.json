The State as a whole was then a terrorist infested area where killings of human beings with illegal firearms were a daily occurrence. Sant Harcharan Singh Longowal (hereinafter referred to as Sant Longowal) was the President of Siromani Akali Dal which was a widely represented association of the Sikh community. Another association consisting of extremists of the Sikh community had recognised one Jurnail Singh Bhindaranwale as the leader. He was supported by another extremist faction called All India Sikh Students Federation (AISSF). Golden Temple at Amritsar has ever been the most revered place of worship for Sikhs all over the world. Within the Golden Temple complex is situate a multi- tier edifice called Akal Takht which is regarded as the seat of Almighty. All important decisions concerning the religious affairs of the community are being adopted at Akal Takht. It has always been eliciting obeisance from the devotees of the great temple. But during the first half of that decade a lot of extremists under the leadership of Jurnail Singh Bhindaranwale had perched inside Akal Takht and army action was resorted to by the Government of India, presumably, to flush out all the illegal occupants therein. The army action so resorted to is now recorded in history as Operation Blue Star which caused the magnificent Akal Takht to crumble down and a large number of occupants therein were crushed to death. It happened in June Sant Longowal was arrested soon after the aforesaid army action, and was interned in prison where he remained till In the meanwhile efforts were on to mollify the wounded feelings of Sikh community. An accord was arrived at between the then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and Sant Longowal on 1985 and a Pact was signed on its basis by the aforesaid two leaders. But the followers of Bhindaranwale including members of AISSF opposed the said Pact as they considered the truce a virtual surrender of Sikh pride to the destroyers of Akal Takht. They publicly abused the leaders who signed the Pact without securing any relief for the Sikh youths lodged in jails and without restoring the Sikh soldiers to their ranks who had impulsively deserted Defence Services on hearing the news of the destruction of Akal Takht. The above was the backdrop of the murderous attack launched on Sant Longowal. According to the prosecution case a criminal conspiracy hatched by some persons to eliminate deceased Sant Longowal and his henchmen for the acts of betrayal of Sikh Panth. They considered it imperative to teach all such betrayers a lesson and terrorise all those who declined to obey the edicts issued by the organisations spearheaded by Jurnail Singh Bhindaranwale. On 1985 an attempt was made on Sant Longowal and his comrades when they visited Golden Temple at Amritsar. But the attempt did not succeed due to some unforeseen developments. Though the security cover of Sant Longowal was beefed up consequent on the aforesaid attempt on his life, the determined conspirators were not deterred by any such security measures. The conspirators came to know that Sant Longowal was scheduled to address a meeting on 1985 at Sherpur Gurudwara. Appellant and his co-assailants were entrusted with the risky task of shooting Sant Longowal and his colleagues. Revolvers and cartridges were supplied to the assailants for achieving the purpose. A motorcycle was also lent to them for swift movement to reach the target at the appropriate opportunity. The meeting at Sherpur Gurudwara started at 30 P.M. But Sant Longowal addressed the audience around 30 P.M. As he was closing the speech, appellant and Jurnail Singh opened firing towards the stage. Some people from the audience made a bold bid to thwart the onslaught. But the assailants continued to shower bullets at the personages on the dais. A number of persons including Sant Longowal sustained serious firearm injuries. The bodyguard of Sant Longowal, besides other police personnel present, tried to catch the assailants. Though one of them (Jurnail Singh) succeeded in escaping, the appellant and Harvinder Singh @ Billa were over-powered and were caught with the illegal firearms in their possession. Sant Longowal was taken to the Civil Hospital at Sangrur and other injured were removed to different hospitals.
