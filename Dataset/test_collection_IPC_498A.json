Despite all efforts, the attitude and relations of her in-laws towards her went from bad to worse. (b) On 1996, the police got a telephonic message from a stranger at 3:30 a.m. that the dead body of a woman was lying in House no. 36, Type II, M.D. University Campus, Rohtak. On coming to know about the incident, Kanwar Singh (the complainant) - father of Kavita reached the spot and identified the body to be that of his daughter.  Rival Submissions: 4) Learned senior counsel for the appellants submitted before this Court that Kavita (since deceased) was suffering from mental depression and psychosis and no case has been made out for bringing the same within the definition of dowry as contained in the [Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961](http://www.liiofindia.org/in/legis/cen/num_act/dpa1961225/). Learned senior counsel further contended that she was suffering from mental depression even before her marriage. Her brother and uncle used to administer anti-depression medicines to her secretly. In support of the same, learned senior counsel relied upon the deposition of Dr. V.P. Mehla, MD, Consultant Psychiatric Centre, Civil Hospital, Rohtak who deposed as under:- Kavita wife of Karambir remained under my treatment and because I have seen her in the OPD on 1996 vide OPD no. 1034/ exhibit DC is her OPD slip. As per my record, patient was suffering from moderate depressing episode. The patient suffered from sadness of mood, absent mindless, loss of interest in the usual activities, decreased sleep and appetite for the last two month, when I first saw her. On mental status examination by me, she was found to have said, irritable facets. She was having depressed mood and expressed pessimistic ideas and complained against her in-laws and husband. She also expressed occasional suicidal ideas. Her Judgment and insight was read to be fair by me. On the basis of above findings, I judged her to be suffering from moderate depressive episode and I had prescribed her capsule flute 20 mg. / OD and I have counseled her and her husband who had accompanied her, regarding the needful treatment and importance of psychosocial support in this disease. History of the patient is contained in exhibit DB. XXXC. Question : How much time did you take examining patient Kavita in this case ? Ans :- I can give no time in this case but routine I used to take new patient 20 to 30 minutes. I have not mentioned any marks of identification or signatures of the patient Kavita in exhibit DD. Whatever was stated by husband of the patient was recorded in exhibit DD. (Volunteered that Chief Complaints recorded in exhibit DD were told by patients husband and patient herself). I cannot specifically state as to what was told by the patient and what was by her husband, exhibit DD contains the mixture of observation of the complaints of patient and her husband. It is correct that patient only came to me on There is no pagination in the patient register but serial no. has been maintained. There is one entry only on 1996 and that is at the fag end of the page. Besides Kavita, who was examined on 96 as a new patient, I also examined old patients on the said date and their registration no is mentioned as 226/94 and 983/96 by the side of entry no. Patient had this illness as first episode. As per my record there was no family or past history of psychiatric illnesections Moderate depressing episode is a diagnostic category as defined in ICD/10 as a depressive illness with symptoms of depression with moderate intensity. In an expert hand, this disease is 100% curable. I did not feel the need of any test of the patient. In a predisposed individual any kind of stress can lead to the precipitation of a depressive disease and illnesections It is incorrect to suggest that I have deposed falsely.      The marriage of Kavita@Kusum (since deceased) was solemnized with Karamvir on Kavita died on 1996 after consuming some poisonous substance at her matrimonial home. The father of the deceased lodged a complaint against the accused persons that he had given dowry on the eve of marriage beyond his means but after 20-25 days of marriage, Karamvir-appellant no. 2 herein, Maya Devi-appellant no.1 herein and brothers Dharamveer and Paramveer and sister Sonika, started harassing his daughter for more money. When Kavita visited her fathers house, she narrated the entire tale of woes to her parents and brother. When the complainant enquired about the matter, the appellants informed the complainant that the appellant no. 2 is in need of money and they also have to perform the marriage of Sonika. A sum of rs. 20,000/- was paid to appellant no. 2 so that the daughter of the complainant is not harassed. It was further stated that the complainant received a letter of his daughter regarding continuous demand for dowry and sufferings meted out to her. The complainant paid a further sum of rs. 25,000/- for the purchase of refrigerator and gold chain to the appellant no. Kavita was sent with her husband on the assurance that the accused family would not harass her in future. Even on the day of sakrant, when the brother of the deceased visited her matrimonial home, the accused threatened them that the household articles of Kavita will be thrown out. A further demand of rs. 30,000/- was made to meet the kitchen expenses by the appellants. Since that demand was not fulfilled, the deceased was left with her father at Delhi. Subsequently, the complainant requested to compromise the matter and tendered his apology in writing. In June 1996, the deceased was brought to home by the accused persons. After some days, when the complainant visited her matrimonial home at Rohtak, he was informed that situation has not changed and whenever she brings money, the peace returns for 10-20 days otherwise she is beaten mercilessly by the accused persons. On 1996, the complainant got the information about the death of his daughter. The case was committed to the Court of Sessions and the accused were found guilty under Section 304B and 498A of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. There is ample evidence that the deceased was harassed, maltreated and was subjected to cruelty, for and in connection with the demands for dowry by the accused. Admittedly, appellant no. 2 was present in his office on 1996 located at M.D. University Campus at Rohtak but he did not attend to his wife at the relevant time.  V.P. Mehla (DW-2) was apprised by the deceased about the harassment and the maltreatment by her in-laws a month prior to her death when she was taken to the aforesaid doctor for the alleged treatment. According to DW-2, the deceased was so much depressed as a result of the act of cruelty meted out to her at the hands of the appellants that she developed suicidal tendencies.

PW-10, the Revenue Divisional Officer, on receipt of the copy of the FIR proceeded on the place and also conducted inquest on the dead body in the presence of witnesses and prepared Ex.P-9, the Inquest Report, wherein he opined that it was not a case of suicide but it was the death by homicide. He also made enquiries from the witnesses including the accused.  Following the same, the dead body was subjected to post mortem by PW-9, the doctor attached to the Government Head Quarters Hospital, Karur, who opined that the deceased appeared to have died of asphyxia due to strangulation about 24-36 hours prior to autopsy.   Pending investigation, A-1 to A-6 were arrested. A-2 came forward to give confessional statement voluntarily and the same was recorded by PW-13, the Deputy Superintendent of Police in the presence of witness, pursuant to which A-2 has produced M.O.1-Nylon rope which was recovered under a recovery Mahazar, Ex.P-1.   The said A-1 demanded jewels and presentation of Rs.5,000/- for Ramzan. She accepted that she told A-1 and A-2 that she will send the same within a week. The next statement of this witness is very significant. She (appellant) told that two months' time will be sufficient for offering the presentation. In other words, she did not make any demand for dowry. That aspect has been accepted by PW-1. Significantly, this witness in her cross examination had admitted that appellant is residing at Coimbatore for the last 35 years. She has categorically admitted that while she went to the house of her daughter, she (appellant) was not present. Therefore, there is no evidence to show that appellant was either present when the demand was made or she herself made any demand.

Whenever she used to remind the appellant that the status and economic position of her father did not permit further dowry being given as demanded, the deceased used to be not only taunted and harassed but also threatened and beaten and at times even driven out of the house. In the month of December, 1984, the appellant appears to have called Suryamani, the elder brother of the deceased, and demanded payment of rs.3,000/- saying that if he really was interested in the welfare of his sister he must immediately pay the amount. About 3 or 4 months prior to the occurrence resulting in the death of Shakuntla Bai, the servant of the appellant appears to have, at the behest of the appellant, called the father of the deceased and when he went to the house of the appellant he told him that he did not want to keep his daughter any longer in the house and he may take her with him. Immediately thereafter during March-April when once the father of the deceased was in the house of his brother-in-law, the deceased was said to have come accompanied by a servant from the village where she was living, with broken utensils in a bag to her Uncle's house at Mahasamund, telling her father that her husband has broken all utensils saying that the brass utensils given by her father, instead of giving modern age steel utensils, have become old and, therefore, get them substituted with new stainless steel utensils. While matters stood thus, the ill-treatment and harassment by the appellant of his wife continued unabated also for further reason that she found out on many occasions the appellant having illicit relations with his Bhabhi Surja Bai. In the background of such events and strained relations, it appears that on 1985 in the marital home at the Village Deori the deceased consumed poison pesticide and died on the same day as a result thereof, in the house of the appellant. The evidence on record, to which our attention has also been drawn by the learned counsel, sufficiently makes out the case of persistent and unabated harassment and acts of cruelty meted out to the deceased by not only pestering her and her relatives to give more and more by way of additional dowry from time to time, but that she has been ill- treated physically and consequently the challenge made to the concurrent findings is not only bereft of substance but does not merit countenance in our hands.", "statute": ["s6"]}, "2010.INSC.1009.txt": {"doc_url": "http://www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/2010/1009.html", "explanation": {"On the night of the marriage itself, the appellant demanded some additional costly items from his wife ": ["s6"], " continued to harass her for money and other goods ": ["s6"], " harass the deceased and to interfere in their private life ": ["s6"], " demands for dowry continued unabated and this information was conveyed by the deceased to her mother, other relatives and her colleagues ": ["s6"], " the deceased visited her mother's home and told her as to the way she was being maltreated ": ["s6"], " the deceased committed suicide by hanging herself  in the main hall of the house of her mother leaving behind three dying declarations in the form of letters Exhibits P-2 to P- PW-1 (the mother of the deceased) who had gone to the market returned and found her daughter hanging from the ceiling fan.": ["s6"], " in the main hall of the house of her mother leaving behind three dying declarations in the form of letters Exhibits P-2 to P- PW-1 (the mother of the deceased) who had gone to the market returned and found her daughter hanging from the ceiling fan.": ["s6"]}, "fact": " On the night of the marriage itself, the appellant demanded some additional costly items from his wife .
