An agreement to that effect was also made. However, the accused persons failed to do so and instead received a sum of rs. 7 lakhs as advance on 2007 and handed over only the possession of the house.

It was alleged in the complaint filed by respondent nos.4 to 7, that respondent nos.1 to 3, in furtherance of a criminal conspiracy, and with common intention, misappropriated huge amounts of funds of `the Association', by misusing their position as office bearers of `the Association'. On the basis of the complaint preferred by respondent nos.4 to 7, First Information Report bearing Crime No.675/2008 was registered at Central Police Station, Ernakulam.  Appellant No.2 in the present appeal \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Giri Nair (also claiming to be an active member of the Association), likewise filed a complaint before the City Police Commissioner, Ernakulam, making similar allegations against respondent nos.1 to 3.  The police filed a final report before the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Ernakulam, on 22.03.2009, based on an affirmation during investigation, for offences under Sections 406, 408, 409, 477A and 120B of the Indian Penal Code. Needless to mention, that the aforesaid chargesheet was based on the complaint addressed by respondents nos.4 to 7 on 09.04.2008, and not the complaint made by the appellants before this Court.  Dissatisfied with the initiation of action against them, respondent nos.1 to 3 filed Criminal M.C.No.4154 of 2009 before the High Court of Kerala (hereinafter referred to as `the High Court\u00e2\u0080\u0099) under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code praying for quashing of the final report (filed by the police in C.C.No.90 of 2009, on the file of the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Ernakulam arising out of Crime No.675/2008). The case projected by respondent nos.1 to 3 before the High Court was, that the allegations contained in the complaint dated 09.04.2008 were in the nature of a private dispute, and was of a purely personal nature, without any involvement of public policy, and as such, the matter could be settled between the parties through an amicable settlement.  And that, it had been so settled.  Along with the aforesaid Criminal M.C.No.4154 of 2009, respondent nos.1 to 9 filed a joint petition seeking compounding under Section 320 of the Criminal Procedure Code. At this juncture, it would be relevant to mention, that respondent nos.4 to 7 were the original complainants on whose complaint, the case came to be registered against respondent nos.1 to 3. Respondent nos.8 and 9 herein, were the General Secretary and Treasurer of `the Association', at the time when Criminal M.C.No.4154/2009 was filed.  According to the assertions made before this Court, the High Court was informed, that the matter had been settled between the parties, and that, no useful purpose would be served in continuing the prosecution.  The High Court, in the above view of the matter, passed the impugned order dated 22.12.2009, whereby, proceedings in CC No.90/2009, pending before the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Ernakulam, were quashed.  Premised on the acknowledged admitted position, that there was no misappropriation, as well as, the fact that the offences alleged in the complaint were purely personal in nature, the High Court agreed with the settlement between the parties, and quashed the proceedings in CC No.90/2009.  We shall now venture to determine the above issue. A perusal of the complaint on the basis of which criminal prosecution came to be initiated against respondent nos.1 to 3 reveals, that the accused persons were described as office bearers of `the Association', during the period from 2004 to 2008. During the course of hearing, it was not disputed, that at the relevant time, respondent no.1 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Mohana Kurup was the President of `the Association'; respondent no.2 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Raveendran was the Secretary of `the Association'; and respondent no.3 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Sayed was the Treasurer of the Association. It was alleged, that during their tenure, as office bearers of the State Committee of `the Association', they had exclusive access to the funds of `the Association'. They, at their own, managed the funds, for and on behalf of `the Association'. Consequent upon their resignation in 2008, when an ad hoc Committee took up charge of the State Committee, it discovered serious misappropriation of funds of the State Committee, which were in the name of the State Committee, and were not accounted for. Even the account books maintained by the State Committee, made no reference to the receipt of such amounts. A specific reference was made to M/s Micro Labs Ltd., Bangalore, which paid a sum of Rs.19,00,000/- two demand drafts being D.D.No.718573 and D.D.No.718574 in the sum of Rs.9,50,000/- each, drawn on the Canara Bank, both dated 17.04.2007. It was also asserted in the complaint, that `the Association' issued two receipts dated 30.04.2007 and 15.05.2007 in acknowledgement of the receipt of the said amounts. It was alleged, that the said amount was never incorporated in the account books of `the Association'. It was also alleged, that respondent nos.1 to 3 dishonestly misappropriated the said amount to themselves, in violation of bye-laws and other regulations/directions of the State Committee, by creating false and fictitious accounts, by altering, destroying and mutilating the original accounts of the State Committee, with a willful intention to obtain illegal financial gains, and to defraud the State Committee. It is also relevant to mention, that consequent upon completion of investigation, the chargesheet dated 22.03.2009, filed against respondent nos.1 to 3, stated thus:- \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe accused persons being the office bearers of the State Committee, All Kerala Chemists & Druggists Association, in furtherance of their common intention to obtain illegal financial gain conspired conjointly and cheated the Association and its members by misappropriating the funds given by various drug companies to AKCDA functioning near South Railway Station, Ernakulam during the period from 17.04.2007 to 11.04.2008. The Demand Drafts and Cheques received were not credited in the account of AKCDA. The accused falsified the accounts of AKCDA and unauthorisedly opened accounts in South Malabar Gramin Bank, Palakkad Branch and ICICI Bank, Edappally Branch and credited the amounts in the said accounts. The DD's and cheques received were encashed in the aforesaid accounts on various dates and an amount of Rs.80,00,000/- was diverted for their own use.

The appellant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s further case is that a single account to receive 95% of the payment due from BSNL was maintained by it and since the amounts received from the respondent-BSNL by cheques did not carry any particulars of the consignment for which such payment was being made it could, in no way, discover excess payment, if any, released by BSNL against the bills sent by the appellant. The appellant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s further case is that on gaining knowledge about the excess payments received by it, an offer for reconciliation of the accounts was made to the BSNL and since any such reconciliation was likely to take 30 to 45 days, the appellant offered to adjust the excess amount credited to its account towards the outstanding bills on an ad hoc basis. A letter dated 10th May, 2006 was, according to the appellant, addressed to the respondent-BSNL in that regard. The respondent-BSNL on the other hand has a different story to tell. According to it four of its officers had abused their official position and fraudulently generated 'voucher numbers' on the duplicate and triplicate copies of the bills submitted by the appellant to facilitate payments as if the said bills were genuine thereby causing wrongful loss to the respondent- BSNL and a corresponding gain to the appellant. There was in this process an excess payment of Rs.7.98 crores made and credited to the account of the appellant by the accounts officer of respondent-BSNL. What is important for the present is that by a letter dated 21st April, 2010, BSNL blacklisted the appellant permanently on the ground that the appellant had committed gross misconduct and irregularities by receiving excessive payments amounting to Rs.7,98,55,508/- from BSNL thereby wrongfully causing loss to the said company.

The couple executed mutual wills in In 1982, the couple executed mutual wills revoking the earlier mutual wills. In 1988, during their lifetime, Smt. Birla formed four trusts and MPB formed the fifth trust. These trusts, 5 in number, covered corporate assets. On 30th July 1990 MPB died. On 1990, Smt. Birla gave directions in respect of MP Birla Trust under clause 6(b) and made nominations of beneficiaries in respect of her four trusts under clause 7(a) of the trust deeds in favour of three named public charitable institutions, viz. , Hindustan Medical Institution (HMI), East India Education Institution (EIEI) and MP Birla Foundation. In terms of the said nominations made after the demise of MPB, the assets of the five trusts estimated at rs.2400 crores stood settled for the benefit of HMI, EIEI and MP Birla Foundation. However, on 15th April 1999 PDB purported to revoke all the five trusts (stood dissolved). On 18th April 1999, Smt. Birla executed her will by which she bequeathed all her properties (including the estate of MPB) to accused no.1, R.S. Lodha and after him his son, the value of which is around rs.2400 crores. Smt. Birla died on 3rd July R.S. Lodha was a trustee of MP Birla Foundation (one of the three public charitable institutions). He was also a trustee of HMI and EIEI prior to the dissolution of the five trusts w.e.f. Appellant herein, Shiva Nath Prasad, accused no.2 was also a trustee in the five trusts. Accused no.3, Dr. V.Gauri Shanker was a trustee in HMI, EIEI and MP Birla Foundation. He was also a trustee in three out of five mutual trusts referred to above.

C/4693 of 2004 alleging offences under the aforestated sections, viz. , 120-B read with 406, 420, 467, 417 and 204 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860, inter alia, on the ground that he was a witness to the intention and the wishes of the couple during their lifetime to leave their estate to charity which decision was made known to everyone close to the couple including the other members of the Birla family. According to the complainant, the couple had accordingly executed mutual wills on two occasions, first in the year 1981 and subsequently in According to the complainant, when the mutual wills were executed in 1981 and 1982, he was consulted and he had taken part in the discussion with MPB. According to the complaint, the couple had decided to dispose of their assets to charity after their demise. Respondent no.2 herein has further alleged in the complaint that in 1988 the couple created five mutual and reciprocal trusts under which the estate went to charity as the remainder beneficiary. Respondent no.2 further alleged that he was involved in the discussion relating to formulation of the terms and conditions to be mentioned in the five trust deeds. He was consulted in the matter of drafting of the said deeds. He was also a witness to the mutual and reciprocal agreements between MPB and PDB in regard to the five trusts. He was also a formal witness to the deeds. He was also a witness to the instrument of nominations of the beneficiaries of the five trusts. He was also a witness to the deed of appointment of trustees of the five trusts. According to respondent no.2, the said five trusts were created by the couple as mutual and reciprocal trusts by which the couple had mutually agreed to leave their estate, after their death, to charity and pursuant to that decision they had nominated the charitable institutions in which the assets held by the five trusts worth rs.2400 crores would vest. According to respondent no.2, the said five trusts were irrevocable and the three public charitable institutions nominated by the couple as beneficiaries were HMI, EIEI and MP Birla Foundation. Respondent no.2 was also, in turn, associated as honorary secretary of HMI, EIEI and MP Birla Foundation. Respondent no.2 herein has alleged in the complaint that he was stunned when he came to know, on the demise of PDB, that the first accused R.S. Lodha had claimed that the estate of PDB, which included the estate of MPB, belonged to him under the above will dated 18th April 1999 made by the deceased PDB. In his complaint, respondent no.2, has stated that when he came to know that R.S. Lodha had made a claim to the entire estate of the Birlas, he made enquiries which revealed to him that R.S. Lodha had criminally conspired with the other accused in criminally misappropriating assets worth rs.2400 crores vested by the above five mutual trusts in the above three charitable institutions and that the accused had converted the charitable endowment for personal gain. Respondent no.2, in his complaint, has further stated that the accused had attempted to create false evidence to show that the five trusts stood revoked and dissolved on 15th April 1999 which is three days before the alleged will dated 18th April 1999 executed by PDB and thereby the assets which had vested in the charitable institutions had been criminally misappropriated by fraud and conspiracy in which the other accused had participated actively. Respondent no.2 herein has further stated in his complaint that the accused have conspired to create false evidence in support of their claim that the five trusts stood dissolved during the lifetime of PDB herself. In his complaint, respondent no.2 has further stated that R.K. Choudhury, one of the trustees in the three out of five trusts was not even aware of the alleged revocation/dissolution of the five trusts by Smt. Birla during her lifetime, as alleged by the accused. According to the complaint, there was no revocation of the five trusts, as claimed by the accused. Respondent no.2 is a chartered accountant. In his complaint, he has pointed out the reasons for the couple deciding to vest the shares of group holding companies of MPB in the above three public charitable institutions, namely, HMI, EIEI and MP Birla Foundation. Respondent no.2 has stated that it was tax planning advised by respondent no.2 and by R.K. Choudhury. The purpose of choosing the three institutions was to make them a vehicle to promote the charitable activities of MPB group. Respondent no.2, in his complaint, has categorically alleged that R.S. Lodha is a qualified chartered accountant, who had won the confidence of the couple and who solely planned his way and eliminated all those who had worked with the couple so as to make Smt. Birla hopelessly dependent on him. According to the complaint, R.S. Lodha was the exclusive advisor and consultant of Smt. Birla personally. He was a director, auditor and the trustee of different companies. According to the complaint, in the last couple of years prior to 1999, R.S. Lodha had come to occupy the central place in the scheme of things of MPB group of companies and charitable endowments. Respondent no.2 has further alleged that similarly Shiva Nath Prasad was a close confidante of late Smt. Birla, having completed 50 years of service with MPB group of companies. He dealt with all the tax matters of Smt. Birla. He filed her tax returns. He entered into correspondence on her behalf with Income Tax Department. He was given a power of attorney to sign, on her behalf, the tax returns. He was a trustee of all the above five mutual trusts. He was a trustee in the three public charitable institutions. He was also a member of the managing committee of HMI and EIEI. Respondent no.2 has further alleged that Dr. Gauri Shanker was a trustee of all the above three public charitable institutions. He was also a trustee of three of the five mutual trusts, viz. , M.P. Birla Trust, Priyamvada Birla Trust and Priyamvada Birla Kosh. Similarly, respondent no.2 has stated in his complaint that the fourth accused, Sushil Kumar Daga, was a long standing employee of the MP Birla Group. He was a member of the managing committee of HMI and EIEI. He was also a trustee of MP Birla Foundation. In his complaint, respondent no.2 herein, has alleged that Shiva Nath Prasad and sectionK. Daga are the witnesses to the letter dated 2003 addressed by late Smt. Birla to R.S. Lodha which has been tendered as codicil in the probate proceedings pending before the High Court. Respondent no.2, in his complaint, has alleged that Shiva Nath Prasad and sectionK. Daga are the witnesses to the said letter which was created in pursuance of the criminal conspiracy to misappropriate the property of the public charitable institutions. In his complaint, respondent no.2 herein, has relied upon one more circumstance in support of his contention that the couple had always desired to leave their estate, after their demise, to charity. In this connection, respondent no.2-complainant has placed reliance on the biography of MPB written by Dr. Gauri Shanker in which a graphic description of the visit by the couple to Tirupathi has been mentioned. In the said book, Dr. Gauri Shanker has mentioned how he had taken the draft trust deed of MP Birla Foundation to His Holiness the Sankaracharya and got it approved by him. In the said book, it is allegedly stated that in the last years of his life, MP Birla had desired that his entire estate should go to charity. In the said book, it is further recited that MP Birla Foundation was the foremost institution formed on 23rd January 1986, its trustees were the three daughters of K.K. Birla, brother-in-law of MP Birla, two professionals from the industrialist group etc. and later Smt. Birla also joined its board as the chairperson and as the trustee. According to the biography, the couple expressed their desire to give their wealth and properties to God and accordingly Dr. Gauri Shanker was requested to translate that idea into reality by drawing a deed of trust. The final draft was prepared. It was taken to Kanchipuram. It was placed before His Holiness Sankaracharya and accordingly the deed was sanctified. This book was published in This circumstance is relied upon in the complaint to show that Dr. Gauri Shanker was aware of the decision of MPB and PDB to dedicate their entire wealth to charity and yet he took part in the conspiracy to divert the endowment worth rs.2400 crores from charity to the personal kitty of R.S. Lodha and after him, his son. According to the complaint, R.S. Lodha, alongwith Shiva Nath Prasad and Dr. Gauri Shanker were the trustees of the said three public charitable institutions whose property stands criminally misappropriated by the first accused pursuant to a criminal conspiracy by the other accused who committed criminal breach of trust. This was possible by virtue of the power and influence of R.S. Lodha and by reason of the long familiarity of the other accused with the couple. According to the complaint, MPB died on 30th July Upto the time of his death, he had done nothing to show the slightest inclination to change his charitable intentions or to put an end to the mutuality expressed wills of 1982 and the trust deeds of 1988 and on the contrary in January and February 1989, the couple had agreed on the final nominations in favour of three public charitable institutions in the presence of the complainant, Shiva Nath Prasad and R.K. Choudhury. Respondent no.2 has categorically stated that after the demise of MPB on 10th September 1990, Smt. Birla, in fact, executed the nominations in accordance with the pious wish of her husband and that the said nominations were mutually agreed nominations of the five trusts duly executed by her. The legal effect of the said nominations were explained by R.K. Choudhury in the presence of the complainant and in the presence of Shiva Nath Prasad to Smt. Birla. Respondent no.2 has further stated that Smt. Birla was told by R.K. Choudhury that the said nominations were irrevocable and that the said Shiva Nath Prasad was fully aware, along with Smt. Birla, that the five trusts along with the nominations were mutual and reciprocal and were irrevocable even by Smt. Birla (survivor) except in terms of clause 19 which provision was common in all the deeds. Respondent no.2 has alleged that in terms of the nominations agreed between MPB and PDB, during the lifetime of MPB and made after the demise of MPB, as explained above, the assets of the five trusts estimated at rs.2400 crores stood finally settled in the three public charitable institutions as remainder beneficiaries. Respondent no.2, in his complaint, has stated that in the second week of April 1999, R.S. Lodha started misleading Smt. Birla. She was made to sign documents which had the effect of misappropriating the assets dedicated to and vested in the three public charitable institutions through the medium of the five trusts. Pursuant to the said conspiracy, on 18th April 1999 which was a Sunday, R.S. Lodha separately called three persons to Birla Park, residence of Smt. Birla and persuaded each one of them by false representations and fraud to attest a document signed by the deceased Smt. Birla. This document is the impugned will by which all the properties of the couple under the five trusts stood diverted from charity. They were converted to become the personal property of R.S. Lodha. The three persons were P.L. Agarwal, Dr. Madan section Vaidya and Mahabir Prasad Sharma. Accordingly, respondent no.2 has complained that the above acts constituted massive fraud on Smt. Birla and on the five trusts; that, the said fraud constituted a criminal breach of trust on the three public charitable institutions which are deprived of endowments worth rs.2400 crores and accordingly in the complaint respondent no.2 has alleged that R.S. Lodha had cheated and defrauded Smt. Birla into believing that she was making a document to leave the property to charity as she and her husband had desired and declared from time to time since 1981- Respondent no.2 has lastly stated in his complaint that four years after the execution of the will dated 18th April 1999, a letter dated 15th April 2003 termed as codicil is brought into existence by R.S. Lodha in conspiracy with Shiva Nath Prasad and sectionK. Daga to fortify the will. It contains a direction in respect of four residential properties which are now directed to R.S. Lodha and after him, his son. Respondent no.2 has alleged that this letter dated 2003 is created as a supporting evidence to the will of Respondent no.2, in his complaint, has stated that Shiva Nath Prasad prepared the balance sheets of the five trusts as on 1999 in June 2000 only to show that the five trusts stood dissolved through deeds prior to the making of the alleged will dated Respondent no.2 has pointed out that R.K. Choudhury was a trustee. He had never resigned from the trusts. He had never ceased to be a trustee. He is not even aware of the dissolution of the trusts on In the circumstances, in his complaint, respondent no.2 has alleged that there was no revocation, oral or in writing, on 1999 or at any time later on. Respondent no.2 has further pointed out in his complaint that the accused have communicated about the dissolution of the trusts to the Income Tax Department only on 27th June 2000 when a letter was addressed by Smt. Birla to the Joint Commissioner of Income Tax, Calcutta, stating that the five trusts have been dissolved on 1999 and that the assets have been transferred to her as the sole beneficiary. The balance sheets of the five trusts as on 1999 prepared by second accused in June 2000 only to show that the trusts stood dissolved w.e.f. Respondent no.2 has alleged that the accused have conspired to create records by entering into correspondence with Income Tax Department. Respondent no.2 has accordingly relied upon the aforestated circumstance in support of his allegation of conspiracy to create ante-dated documents to show retro-active revocation of the five trusts. Relying upon the aforestated circumstances, the complainant has alleged in his complaint that the accused had entered into a criminal conspiracy, the ultimate object of which was to misappropriate dishonestly the charitable estate and converting the said estate to their own use. Respondent no.2 has further alleged that the object of the alleged will of 1999 was to destroy the interest of the three public charitable institutions in which the estate had irrevocably vested; that, the purported dissolution of the trusts was a step in the execution of criminal conspiracy; that, the modus operandi of the accused was to attain this illegal object fraudulently by showing that the five trusts were dissolved during the lifetime of Smt. Birla who was fraudulently induced and cheated as she had no legal knowledge nor access to independent legal advice; that, Smt. Birla was a lay housewife who had no knowledge of legal intricacies; that, she was deceived into executing a fraudulent will on That the three attesting witnesses were also deceived and finally the accused have even deliberately suppressed the facts relating to the five trusts from the application for probate made to the High Court in respect of the alleged will dated Respondent no.2 has stated in his complaint that a trustee becoming a party to the dissolution of an irrevocable trust is dishonest and guilty of criminal breach of trust; that, there was nothing to show that Smt. Birla was advised to convert the properties dedicated to public charities to personal properties and on the contrary by filing and signing balance sheets of five trusts the accused have sought to create evidence of the dissolution of the trusts and thereby they have aided and abetted misappropriation of the properties belonging to public charitable institutions. The accused have used their dominant position in the five trusts and in the three public charitable institutions to illegally revoke the five trusts and thereby dishonestly misappropriated the properties of the three public charitable institutions which constituted offence punishable under section 120-B read with section 406 of Indian Penal Code, 1860. In execution of the conspiracy, the accused, in fact, misappropriated the properties of the public charitable institutions by illegally showing that the five trusts stood revoked and by transferring the properties held by five trusts or the three public charitable institutions to Smt. Birla as her personal properties as is evidenced from the balance sheets filed on behalf of the five trusts by the second accused. Hence, respondent no.2 has alleged that the accused were also guilty of substantive offence of criminal breach of trust under section 406, Indian Penal Code, 1860. Respondent no.2 has also alleged in his complaint that R.S. Lodha was liable for offence punishable under section 420, Indian Penal Code, 1860 inasmuch as he was the instrumentality of procuring the will dated 1999 by inducing Smt. Birla by false representation to sign the said will, divesting the properties from charity and converting it to the assets of the first accused. Lastly, respondent no.2 has alleged that accused nos.2, 3 and 4, all of whom were trustees and/or members of managing committee in one or more of the three public charitable institutions had connived both by positive acts of commission and omission to aid and abet accused no.1 R.S. Lodha in the offence of criminal breach of trust for which they are liable to be punished under section 109 read with section 406, Indian Penal Code, 1860.", "statute": ["s5"]}, "1996.INSC.1418.txt": {"doc_url": "http://www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/1996/1418.html", "explanation": {"entered into a conspiracy to misuse the said cheques": ["s5"], "the blank signed cheques issued in the year 2001-2002 had been fraudulently used": ["s5"]}, "fact": " In brief, the allegations of the aforesaid complainant were that during the year 1983, the appellants came in contact with the complainant Lakhu Bhai Pathak and led him to believe that they wielded sufficient influence in India to secure for him lucrative contracts in India.

This Corporation was a Municipal Council until about January 2004. It had framed a housing scheme in the year 1997 named as \u00e2\u0080\u0098Gharkul\u00e2\u0080\u0099 (i.e. Small house) to construct 11,424 houses on the Municipal land for the benefit of slum dwellers. As stated above, although there are 57 accused, the main persons involved in this defalcation are stated to be two former Presidents of the erstwhile Municipal Council, namely, one Shri Sureshdada Jain and one Pradeep Raysoni, and two partners of a construction company known as Khandesh Builders viz. Rajendra Mayur and Jagannath Vani. Shri Sureshdada Jain is said to be the main share-holder of this company. Shri Sureshdada Jain is stated to have been the President of Jalgaon Municipal Council from May 1985 to July 1994. Thereafter he was the Minister of Housing in the Shivsena\u00e2\u0080\u0093Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Government, in the State, during 1995-2000. He is presently an MLA of Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) from Jalgaon city. He was a minister in the present Congress-NCP Government until recently. The appellant is also an MLA of NCP from Jalgaon (Rural) Constituency, and on the date of the impugned order he was a Minister of State in the State Government. Subsequently he has resigned as a Minister. Out of the 57 accused persons 4 have died. Out of the remaining, 2 accused are absconding, and the above referred 2 former Presidents and 2 contractors are in custody. Remaining 47 accused including the appellant have been granted bail. In 1997 when he was a Minister of Housing, Shri Sureshdada Jain persuaded HUDCO to give loan of about 66 crores to the Jalgaon Municipal Council for the above Housing Scheme. He is said to have been instrumental in constituting a \u00e2\u0080\u0098High Powered Committee\u00e2\u0080\u0099 in the Municipal Council which was to supervise this work. The appellant was one of its members. The scheme was to be completed in 9 months but has not been completed so far. Pradeep Raysoni was the President of the Municipal Council during May 1996 to May 1997. As per the Charge-sheet the execution of the scheme was entrusted to Khandesh builders, violating all norms, and statutory and other legal requirements. They have been given huge interest-free mobilization advances which amongst other reasons have led to this huge liability. The work not having been completed, and the loan not having been repaid, the liabilities for the Municipal Corporation towards the interest amount have increased, and it will take quite a few years for the Corporation to repay the loan. Shri Sureshdada Jain is said to have led the majority in the Jalgaon Municipal Council at the relevant time under a group known as the \u00e2\u0080\u0098Shahar Vikas Aghadi\u00e2\u0080\u0099 (i.e. City Development Front). It is alleged that Shri Sureshdada Jain in his capacity as the Minister decided to use the lower income group scheme for wrongful gain, which has resulted into huge liability to the Municipal Corporation, and wrongful gain for himself and other conspirators. It is alleged that he arranged the funds from HUDCO for this particular project, and saw to it that the contract is given to Khandesh builders at exorbitant rates, ignoring the lower bid given by another contractor. The councilors were made to approve all the decisions of the above referred committee which was controlled by earlier referred Pradeep Raysoni. The investigation revealed that the committee was only for the namesake, and it was Raysoni who was taking all the decisions. No written orders were passed. Large advances were released to the builders under what was called as \u00e2\u0080\u0098Ummeed Manjuri\u00e2\u0080\u0099 (i.e. approval in anticipation), and all the Municipal Councilors were made to sign those decisions.", "statute": ["s5"]}, "2009.INSC.1099.txt": {"doc_url": "http://www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/2009/1099.html", "explanation": {"Sh.

As per the said complainant, by respondent no.2 one Amrinder Kaur and her husband Col. Hargobind Singh owned agricultural property, bearing Khata Nos. 40 and They were unable to look after the property and, therefore, appointed Hargursharan Singh, respondent no. 2 herein (the real brother of Col. Hargobind Singh), as their general attorney. Respondent no. 2 herein, by virtue of general power of attorney, sold the aforementioned land and delivered possession to the purchasers. He described appellant-Parminder Kaur as a stranger. Two Civil Suits came to be filed by the appellant, Parminder Kaur, claiming to be holding Power of Attorney for Amrinder Kaur, against the purchasers. They were Civil Suit Nos. 266 of 2002 and 267 of In those Civil Suits, she prayed for the cancellation of the Sale Deeds. According to the 3 prosecution, while instituting these suits on 2002, the appellant had filed a false affidavit that she had come to know regarding the Sale Deed only on 2002 and had obtained a certified copy of Revenue Record on According to the complainant, in fact, the appellant had actually moved for the certified copy of Khatauni on 2002 and had already received the copy on On that allegation, it was contended in the FIR that she had committed the offences as alleged. The High Court took the view that the FIR, as well as, the material collected by the prosecution were good enough at least to proceed and it could not be said that no offence was disclosed from the same. It is this judgment of the High Court, which is challenged before us. 4. We have seen the FIR closely, on the basis of which the offences were registered. This report has been authored by respondent no. 2 Hargursharan Singh S/o Shri Gurbaksh Singh. It has been stated in this report that he held a power of attorney on behalf of one Col. Hargobind Singh and \"Amrinder Kaur\" and on that basis, he sold the land of Amrinder Kaur to one Col. Sarabjeet Singh S/o Avtar Singh and Namrata Chandi D/o Hargursharan Singh (i.e. the daughter of the complainant). It was pointed out that the 4 registration was effected in the same year. Similarly, he had sold one other land of Col. Hargobind Singh to one Prabhjyot Singh S/o Teja Singh and Balbir Singh S/o Gurjit Singh. He also claimed that some other land out of the total land was also sold to one Manjeet Singh S/o Jagir Singh and Balbir Singh S/o Gurjit Singh. It was further asserted that the lands were in cultivation of the vendees. One \"unrelated lady\" Parminder Kaur W/o Col. Hargobind Singh, R/o Village Behait, Distt. Rampur, who had no right in the said land, had filed two Civil Suits, being Civil Suit Nos. 266 of 2002 and 267 of 2002 against Hargursharan Singh (the complainant) and also filed Civil Suit no. 268 of 2002 against Prabhjyot Singh in the Court of Civil Judge, Rampur. It was claimed that said suits were pending disposal. It was further claimed that the suits were filed by Parminder Kaur (appellant herein) and she supported the same with a false affidavit, in which she stated that she learnt about the sale of agricultural land on 2002 and immediately, she applied for the certified copy of the Revenue records, which were made available to her on 2002 and without any delay, she filed the present suit. It was pointed out further that Parminder Kaur (appellant herein) had already applied for certified copy of Revenue Records on 2002 and the same was made 5 available to her on However, to overcome the limitation, she altered the date from 2002 to 2002 and 2002 to 2002 and It was further claimed in the said report that Parminder Kaur had filed Civil Suit no. 267 of 2002 in the capacity of power of attorney on behalf of \"Amrinder Hargobind Singh\" and in fact, she had no concern with the land in question. It was further pointed out that the real owners of the land had not objected to the sale of land and the sale was being objected to by Parminder Kaur, who was an \"unrelated woman\" and she had no right to interfere. It was then claimed that Parminder Kaur, in order to cause loss to the complainant, interpolated the dates of Revenue Records and, therefore, the documents were forged and the same were produced in the Court in order to defraud the Court and a false affidavit had been sworn in the Court and she was liable to be punished for the same.", "statute": ["s5"]}, "2005.INSC.643.txt": {"doc_url": "http://www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/2005/643.html", "explanation": {"He was granted cheque discounting facility.": ["s5"], "For the said purpose, he deposited his title deeds on or about 1988 5.
