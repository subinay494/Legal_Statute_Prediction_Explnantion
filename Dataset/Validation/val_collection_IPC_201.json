STATE OF BIHAR [2004] INSC 160 (12 March 2004)  Twenty seven persons were named in the FIR and charge sheet was filed initially against 24 persons.  In terms of Section 319 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (in short the 'Code'), three more persons were added.  Twenty seven persons were convicted by the trial Court and all of them filed appeals before the High Court.  It has to be noted, as stated by learned counsel for the appellants, that one of them Lakhan Singh has served out the sentence, and two others namely Balinder Singh and Gaya Singh were absconding.  Three of the accused persons died during pendency of the appeal before the High Court.  Prosecution version which led to the trial in a nutshell is as follows:  On 6.7.1983, informant Ramu Yadav (PW-11), after easing was returning to his house at about 8 a.m. and his uncle Kishun Yadav (hereinafter described as 'deceased D-1') at that time was also returning to his house from the northern direction and he was ten yards ahead of the informant.  When the informant and the deceased Kishun reached a lane near the house of Sadhu Kahar, the informant saw a number of persons variously armed with Saif, Garasa, Bhala,guns etc.  coming out from the Dalan of Bhuneshwar Singh who all challenged deceased Kishun and attacked him.  Appellant Lakhan Singh, who was carrying a bag, took out a bomb from his bag and hurled it on deceased Kishun, who after receiving injury, managed to enter the house of his cousin Phekju Yadav (PW-6).  Following him, all the appellants alongwith Biro Singh, Pragash Singh and Ram Singh (all the three since dead) along with 15 to 20 others, variously armed entered the house of Pheku Yadav.  The informant also, following the appellants and their companions, entered the house of his uncle Pheku Yadav (PW-6).  In the meantime, Gopi Yadav, father of informant (hereinafter referred to as 'deceased D-2') also reached there and, thereafter both deceased, Gopi and Kishun climbed on the Matkmotha (box room) in order to save their lives.  Appellants Lakhan Singh, Ram Charitar Singh, Ram Janam Singh, Chhotan Singh,Raghu Singh, Balindra Singh, Manoj Singh, Bhola Singh, Baban Singh, Nandu Singh, Yado Singh and ten to fifteen unknown persons also, along with weapons, climbed from outside to the roof of house and other appellants remained in the courtyard and verandah of the house.  The appellants, who had climbed went to Matkotha, started assaulting both the deceased with guns, Bhala, Saif etc.  The appellants, who had gone on the roof of the house, uprooted the tiles and bamboo sticks of Matkotha and appellant Lakhan Singh, after sprinkling kerosene oil on the roof, set fire and, thereafter the appellants, who had climbed on Matkotha, dragged deceased Kishun and Gopi to the verandah where they, after piercing Garasa, Bhala, Saif, killed them.  Thereafter, appellant Raghu Singh, Janardhan Singh, Ram Charitar Singh, Ram Janam Singh, Dani Singh,Chander Singh, Lakhan Singh along with co-accused Biro Singh carried the dead bodies on a cot towards eastern side of village and other appellants, after scrapping the blood which had fallen on the ground with straw, put it in a nearby well and they also washed the blood drops from the walls of the house by water and mud and, thereafter, they also went following the dead bodies.  After some time, the informant saw smoke and flames of fire rising from the side of eastern boundary of his village where the appellants had burnt the dead bodies.  They remained at the place of burning for about two hours, and thereafter they again came back to the houses of informant (PW-11) and Pheku Yadav (PW-6) and took away rice, wheat, gram, clothes, ornaments, pots etc.  The occurrence was witnessed by female members of the family of informant including his mother, aunt, sister, wife of brother of Pheku Yadav (PW-6) and number of other villagers.  Old enmity, giving rise to number of cases between the prosecution party and appellants, was stated to be the motive of the occurrence.  The fardbayan of informant was recorded on the day of occurrence at 8.30 p.m. by Sub Inspectort Uzair Alam (PW-13).  The informant, in his fardbayan stated that because appellants did not allow him to leave the house,he could not go to the Police Station earlier.", "statute": ["s2"]}, "2005.INSC.503.txt": {"doc_url": "http://www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/2005/503/.html", "explanation": {"Those accused persons, according to PW-2, volunteered that they had kidnapped Madhu and that they would show the place from where the dead body can be recovered.": ["s2"], "During the night intervening 20th/21st May 1996 they were interrogated and their disclosure statements were recorded which are Exhibits P-15 and P16 in which they volunteered to take the police and others to the place where they have buried the dead body of Madhu.

In brief, the prosecution case is that on 19th of May 1996 at about 00 AM, a minor boy named Madhu left his house for going to his father's shop.  It was vacation time for the Schools.  In the afternoon when the father, M.K.  Krishnamurthy, PW-7 returned home for lunch and enquired about his son, as he had not come to the shop, till evening family waited for return of the boy and thereafter the search began.  Various telephone calls were made to the relatives and enquiries were made from other places where the boy was expected to have gone.  Again in the next morning search was made for Madhu but he was not traced and as such at about 00 P.M.  on 20th May 1996, PW-2, M.K.  Prakash, uncle of Madhu lodged the first missing complaint in Hosadurga Police Station.  The police registered the complaint as Crime no.99/96 on the same day.  Thimmanna, PW-1, another Uncle of Madhu went to the house of Prakash, whose house is near the house of Krishnamurthy, PW- At about 30 PM or 45 PM, a telephone call was received on Telephone no.8537 at the house of PW-2 M.K.  Prakash which was picked up by PW-1 Thimanna.  He heard one male voice saying that he knew that they are in search of Madhu and that Madhu is in their custody, he will be released if the ransom amount of rs.50,000/- is paid.  It was said that the ransom amount of rs.50,000/- is to be thrown in a bundle on the tracks of the railways running between Arasikere and Beerur before 00 P.M.  After receipt of this telephonic call, PW-1 immediately rushed to the Police Station and lodged a complaint at about 00 PM.  On this, the P.S.I.  Shri B.S.  Rajashekhar, PW-16, deputed A.S.I.  Shri M.G.  Gangadharappa, PW- and one P.C.  Constable Rudriah to make a search of the missing boy.  PW- 2, Prakash along with his brother Srinivas and the police officials proceeded in a Taxi to Arsikere in search of the boy.  They reached Arsikere at about 00 PM.  Thereafter enquiries were made at the sectionT.D.  Booths at Arsikere for finding out from where the call was made and to trace the person who made the call to Hosadurga.  Two STD booth owners informed that the calls were made from their booth to Hosadurga by two boys and one of the sectionT.D.  Booth owners informed the police party that the telephone to Hosadurga was made by two boys from his telephone booth at about 30 O' clock.  Thereafter the police party along with PW-2 went to Arasikere Railway Station and proceeded towards Beerur along the railway track.  When they proceeded about two and a half to three kilometers, they saw two boys coming in their direction along the railway track at about 30 or 40 PM.  When the boys reached near them, it was noticed by PW- 2 that one of them Venkatesh, A-1, is his relative.  On seeing the police party along with other persons those two boys started running away.  However, they were chased and caught.  Those accused persons, according to PW-2, volunteered that they had kidnapped Madhu and that they would show the place from where the dead body can be recovered.  From there they were brought to police station when it was about 00 P.M.  Both the accused persons were put up in the police lock up.  During the night intervening 20th/21st May 1996 they were interrogated and their disclosure statements were recorded which are Exhibits P-15 and P16 in which they volunteered to take the police and others to the place where they have buried the dead body of Madhu.  The police party along with accused and others proceeded towards Vedavathi river bank wherefrom dead body of Madhu was exhumed from the sand at the bank of the Vedavathi river from the spot pointed out by the accused persons.  The post mortem was conducted by PW-3 Dr.  Ravikar on 21st May who found the following injuries on the body : 1.  There was haemorrhage in the sub-tutaneous tissue and in the muscles of the neck in the region of hyoid and thyroid cartilage; 2.  There was haemorrhage in the retro pharyngael tissue at the base of the tongue; 3.  There was sub-mucus haemorrhage in the larynx; and 4.  Sheath and intima of the carotid artery are lacerated with effusion of blood in the walls.  The doctor opined that the death was due to asphyxia as a result of throttling.  The accused persons faced trial and were acquitted by the Sessions Court.  In appeal, the acquittal of the accused was set aside by the High Court and they were, as aforementioned, convicted.

Mohapatra, Y.K.Sabharwal.  Y.K.  Sabharwal, J.  Subash Chandra Panda (A1), Kunja Ramana (A2), Narayan Mazumdar (A3) and Kalpana Mazumdar (A4), the appellants before us, are facing death penalty.  The charge against them is of kidnapping and murder of a child Ranjeet Mohanty @ Rana, aged four years.  They were charged for offences under Sections 364, 302 and 201 read with 34 Indian Penal Code, 1860.  The First Information Report was registered at the instance of Chitranajan Mohanty, PW He reported that the four appellants and Simanchal Padhi had kidnapped his nephew on 30th April, 1997 and subsequently killed him.  According to the FIR on 1st May, 1997 in the early morning while he had gone out to attend the call of nature he observed that a person was bringing something on his shoulders and he came towards the pond.  The person was A PW7 caught him and an alarm was raised.  People gathered there.  Some are named in the FIR.  They found that A3 was carrying the dead body of the deceased and on being asked he said that he has not murdered the child alone but some other persons were also involved in the murder and he can identify them.  He took all the persons to the house of A2 who finding A3 and others threatened to assault everyone and his field servants also came with lathi and tangi.  At that time they came back but with the help of villagers they again went to the house of A2 and then found that there is none in the house.  In the prayer room of the house they found the nails of the dead child lying with the blood as also the hair of the child.  A3 told them that in the room the nail, hair and the tongue of the child were cut and Simanchal Padhi offered prayers whereafter they took the child alive in the jeep of A2 to the house of A1 where the child was murdered by holding his leg and hand and throttling his neck.  Simanchal Padhi, A1 and A2 told A3 that they will pay rs.25,000/- to throw the boy.  When he was throwing the boy in the pond PW7 caught him red After hearing this they all went to the house of A There Simanchal Padhi \"the tantrik\" said that he had killed the boy and he can give life to him.  He offered prayers near the body for three hours and told everybody to wait but he failed to give life to the boy and ran from the house.  handed.  But he was caught with his associates and handed over to the police.  The four appellants were charged for the offences as aforesaid, the tantrik Simanchal Padhi having already died.  It is on record that PW7 was an accused in the case of murder of Simanchal Padhi though we do not know as to what was the result of that case.  The prosecution in order to bring home the charges examined 15 witnesses.  Three witnesses were examined on behalf of the defence.  PW14, Hari Chand Sahu, was examined by the prosecution as an eye-witness to the occurrence.  According to the prosecution, the deceased was kidnapped and murdered as the accused wanted to offer a human sacrifice to appease the deities on the asking of the tantrik who told them that as a result of the sacrifice A1 will get a gold pot and A2 will be blessed with a son.  A3 was to get rs.25,000/-, A4 is daughter of A PW14 was an employee of A He deposed to have seen everything but did not speak out on the threat that on so doing he would be killed.  PW7 claims to be an eye-witness having seen A3 throwing the body of his deceased nephew and caught A3 red handed, A3 is stated to have made extra-judicial confession before PW7 and PWs1, 2, 3 & On appreciation of evidence in particular the testimony of PWs7 and 14, the learned Additional Sessions Judge held appellants guilty of the offences earlier noticed and considering the case to be rarest of rare imposed on the appellants death penalty.  The death penalty has been confirmed by the High Court while disposing of the death reference and the criminal appeal filed by the appellants challenging their conviction and sentence.  The main evidence that has been relied upon by the High Court as well as by the Sessions Court for holding the appellants guilty is the testimony of PW14 as an eye-witnesections PW7 has also been relied upon in respect of matters noticed hereinbefore as an informant leading to FIR being registered.  PW14 has given a detailed account of the role of each of the accused.  The submission urged before the Additional Sessions Judge and the High Court that PW14 was an accomplice and was not a witness to the offence was not accepted.  PW14 was held to be a mere mute spectator.  The same submission has been urged before us.  Learned counsel for the appellants submitted that although they do not dispute the factum of kidnapping and brutal murder of a young child ostensibly with a view to offer a human sacrifice to appease the deities yet their conviction is unsustainable as it is based on the sole testimony of an accomplice alone without any corroboration.  It is contended that it would be highly unsafe to rely upon the testimony of PW14 and convict the appellants.  The contention is that if the testimony of PW14 is discarded there would be no evidence to connect the appellants with the offences.  It has also been contended that in none of the material aspects on which PW14 deposed there is any corroboration.  Let us first see as to what PW14 has deposed.  For appreciating the testimony of PW14, it has also to be kept in view that his statement was recorded by the police after 19 days of the occurrence.  He left the place of occurrence and went to his own village.  Admittedly he did not narrate the incident to anyone even when he was in his village.  He was working in the hotel of A1 for the last five years.  PW14 was examined in court on 13th December, 1999.  PW14 stated that about three years back tantrik abovenamed came to him and asked him about the house of A1 which he told him.  A1 called him and one rickshaw puller at 10 p.m.  and gave a torch light to him and one crow-bar to the rickshaw puller.  A1, A3 along with the witness and rickshaw puller went to river side along with puja articles.  The river was crossed at 12 midnight.  A1 performed puja on his land.  Next day at 10 p.m.  A1 and the tantrik along with the witness again went to the land of A1 to perform puja and they returned after performing the said puja.  Next day morning one Dhanu Mistri was sent to the place of puja to dig a ditch.  On the third day rickshaw puller was sent to dig that place.  On Sunday morning tantrik told A1 to collect a black cock.  On the same day at night they all went to the ditch with the cock.  A1 asked PW14 to cut the cock in the ditch.  PW14 did accordingly.  The tantrik placed cross-bar inside the ditch and became unconscious.  PW14 entered the ditch on the directions of A1 and stood there out of fear and thereafter he was asked by A1 to come out.  Accused A3 also went into the ditch.  The tantrik told A3 that golden pot will not be available that day.  After about 2 days on 30th April, 1997 he (PW14) heard that one boy was missing.  At about 7 p.m.  PW14 was called by A1 to his house.  There A1 also came in a jeep and A3 brought one child covered with a cloth.  A4 caught the boy and directed PW14 to go to the jeep.  PW14 along with tantrik and A1 sat in the jeep of A They all went and stayed in the house of A All of them stayed in one room and PW14 in another room.  They told PW14 not to tell about the matter to anybody otherwise he will be killed.  At about 10 p.m.  , PW7 came in search of the boy.  He enquired about the Witchcraft from A2 who told him that Witchcraft was not there.  Thereafter PW7 returned.  Simanchal Padhi thereafter started puja path at about 12 midnight.  All sat in the jeep, went to a place where ditch was prepared.  They all went to the ditch giving a torch to PW14 to watch if anybody may come.  PW14 has deposed that A4 caught the leg of the boy, A1 pressed his belly, A2 caught the chest of the boy and tantrik was doing mantra path and A3 caught the neck of the child and the child died there.  They all returned in a jeep.  He further deposed that hearing that the boy was caught out of fear he went to his village.  PW14 deposed to have witnessed all the details of the occurrence.  He has given roles played by all the accused and also detailed accounts of the events of four days earlier than the date of kidnapping and killing of the boy.  PW14 has further deposed that the tongue of the boy was cut who was alive when taken in the jeep to the ditch but he was not crying.  The deposition of PW14 makes it abundantly clear that he was a witness to all the events up to the killing of the boy.  PW14 stated that he was given a torch to watch if anybody comes at the place of occurrence.  This shows that PW14 was deputed to watch that when the four accused were killing the boy in the manner deposed by him, no one comes there.  In other words, it means that in case he finds someone coming while the accused were killing the boy either he should inform them or ensure that nobody comes.  He is said to be doing all this on account of fear and also on account of his being an employee of A He did not narrate the incident to anyone for 19 days even when he was away to his village.  Without going into the question whether PW14 was an accomplice or not, it is evident, on the facts and circumstances noticed above, it is not safe to convict the appellants on the sole testimony of PW Further, it is also to be borne in mind that investigation of the case has been most tardy and unsatisfactory.  Despite the fact that PW14 deposed about the tongue of the boy being cut and PW7 deposed that the tongue, hair and nail of the boy were found in the house of A2, neither those articles were seized nor it was explained as to what has happened to the said articles.  Moreover, the medical evidence does not support the cutting of the tongue.  The age of A2 was more than It was not explained whether A2 had a child or not and besides testimony of PW14 what was the material to substantiate the motive attributed to him that he wanted a child for which he became party to the sacrifice of the boy on the asking of the tantrik.  It is also not explained as to what was the inter-connection between A1 and A There is nothing on record to show that either they were friends or relatives.  How they became common parties to the sacrifice of one human-being, one in lurement of a golden pot and other a son.  None of these aspects were enquired into.  Further the age of A4 was about 17 years at the time of occurrence.  If A3 was to get rs.25,000/- as stated in the FIR of PW7 why the young girl of that age was involved.  All these aspects remained in the realm of mysteries thus raising bona fide and reasonable doubt about the story of the prosecution.  None bothered to investigate these aspects.  The prosecution rested its case entirely on PW14 without any corroboration of his testimony on any of the material aspects.  We have minutely examined the testimony of PW14 and for the reasons above noted find it difficult to affirm the conviction of the appellants on that basis alone.  It is clear that if the sole testimony of PW14 is not relied upon there would be no evidence to connect the appellants except A3 with the commission of the offence.  Under these circumstances, A1, A2 and A4 are entitled to the benefit of doubt.  Regarding the third accused Narayan Mazumdar his position is different.  We have given our sincere and anxious consideration to case against the third accused.  In our view even after discarding the testimony of PW14 there is ample evidence against him.  It is neither disputed nor could be disputed, having regard to evidence on record, that this accused was caught red handed while throwing dead body of the deceased by the side of the tank.  To that effect there is clinching evidence of PW7 who saw A3 disposing of the body.  The FIR was registered on the report of PW However the contention of learned counsel for the third accused was that the circumstance of throwing of dead body of deceased by A3 can only lead to his conviction for offence under Section 201 Indian Penal Code, 1860 and not under Section We are unable to agree with the aforesaid contention of learned counsel.  It stands established from medical evidence that the deceased died homicidal death.  It was due to asphyxia on account of strangulation.  None has questioned this finding.  It is unquestionable on the evidence produced on record.  It is also unquestionable and has also not been questioned that the prosecution has proved, as stated earlier, throwing by A3 the body of the deceased by the side of the tank on early hours of 1st May, 1997 and at that time he was caught red handed by PW The testimony of PW1, PW2, PW3 and PW6 is also to the same effect.  The accused also made an extra judicial confession before them that he alone had not killed the boy but other appellants were also with him.  We have already given the reasons why the conviction of other accused cannot be maintained.  Insofar as this appellant is concerned, there are the following circumstances: (1) Extra judicial confession made to the prosecution witnesses.  (2) Recording of the said confession also in First Information Report.  (3) Caught red handed while disposing of the dead body.  (4) Absence of explanation how the dead body came in his possession either by way of suggestion in the cross examination of prosecution witnesses or in his statement recorded under Section 313 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.  We are conscious of the fact that extra judicial confession for making it a basis for conviction by itself is a week piece of evidence, such evidence deserves strict scrutiny.  At the same time, however, strong circumstantial evidence can get strength from extra judicial confession.  That circumstance, in the present case, is the fact of third accused being apprehended red handed when he threw the dead body.  It is an important piece of circumstantial evidence against him.  Having regard to the facts of the case we see no reason for not drawing a presumption against the third accused for having committed the murder of the child.", "statute": ["s3", "s2"]}, "2008.INSC.20.txt": {"doc_url": "http://www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/2008/20/.html", "explanation": {"two accused persons had murdered one deceased Sivakumar who had strained relationship with Accused no.  2 Moyyasamy.": ["s3"], "This trespass incident, seems to have taken place on Since there was an altercation between accused Moyyasamy and his brother in which accused Moyyasamy had stabbed on the neck of Arunachalam, he (Arunachalam) had reported the matter to the police.": ["s2"]}, "fact": " Naolekar & V.S.

This appeal challenges the judgment of the High Court whereby the conviction of the appellant- Mani for an offence under Section 302 Indian Indian Penal Code, 1860, 1860, 1860 read with Section 34 as also the conviction under Section 201 Indian Penal Code, 1860.  have been confirmed by the High Court.  2.  Originally, there were two accused persons, however, accused no.2 Moyyasamy has been acquitted by the High Court.  State has not challenged the acquittal of accused Moyyasamy.  We have to therefore consider only whether the High Court was justified in confirming the conviction of the appellant for the offences stated above.  3.  The prosecution case was that the two accused persons had murdered one deceased Sivakumar who had strained relationship with Accused no.  2 Moyyasamy.  The relationship was strained on account of the cattle belonging to the father of the deceased namely P.W.1 Arunachalam having grazed in the field belonging to accused Moyyasamy.  In fact, both P.W.1 Arunachalam and accused Moyyasamy are the real brothers while deceased Sivakumar and P.W.2 Amulnathan were the sons of Arunachalam.  On account of the cattle trespass into the field of A.2 Moyyasamy, there was a quarrel.  This trespass incident, seems to have taken place on Since there was an altercation between accused Moyyasamy and his brother in which accused Moyyasamy had stabbed on the neck of Arunachalam, he (Arunachalam) had reported the matter to the police.  4.  The occurrence in question, according to the prosecution, took place about two months thereafter on It seems that according to the prosecution, P.W.1 Arunachalam and deceased Sivakumar were chatting with the family members when accused no.  1- Mani came there and had a cup of coffee with P.W.1 Arunachalam and his family.  Mani is said to have taken Sivakumar to his house.  This was at about 00 p.m.  Since Mani did not turn up till 00 p.m.  , P.W.1 went to the house of the appellant Mani and found that blood was oozing from the house through the water passage underneath the door frame.  The house was found locked.  P.W.1 Arunachalam therefore came back and he was informed by PW.2 Amulnathan that Sivakumar was found in the company of appellant Mani and acquitted accused Moyyasamy at about 00 p.m.  Though P.W.1 Arunachalam was disturbed on account of this, he did nothing and only on the next morning at 6O clock he went to the house of the accused and found trail of blood near the house of Mani and ultimately from that he traced out the body of the deceased which was lying down in the nearby field belonging to one P.W.5 Chinnammal.  It is then that P.W.1 Moyyasamy rushed to Yercaud policestation and gave a complaint.  The case was registered under Section 302 Indian Penal Code, 1860.  5.  During investigation which was done on 1996 the house of appellant which was locked was broken open by the police and the house was searched.  Some blood stained materials like cement flooring, human hair and blood stained brass lock were seized by the investigating officer.  It was found in the post-mortem examination that the deceased had suffered six injuries on various parts of the body including the neck and that he had died due to the injuries to the vital organs and also due to the hemorrhage.  The seized material was sent for the chemical analysis.  6.  The investigating officer came to know that accused appellant had surrendered before the Court.  He, therefore, filed an application for the police custody on 1996 and ultimately obtained the same on The prosecution further contended that on the same day on the basis of the discovery statement made by the accused appellant, blood stained clothes of the accused namely M.Os 15-17 and blood stained Koduval namely M.O.  18 were recovered from the place pointed out by the accused.  The second accused (Moyyasamy) was arrested on 1996 and his blood stained clothes were also recovered.

Four persons - Gopal Sah, Dasrath Sah, Bhushan Sah and Raghunath Sah were tried by the Additional Sessions Judge, Saharsa for offences punishable under Sections 302/34, 304/34,201/34 and 120B of the Indian Indian Penal Code, 1860, 1860.  The trial court in its judgment dated 14th September 1985 held the first three accused guilty of the offence under Section 302/34 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 and sentenced them to undergo imprisonment for life 2 whereas Raghunath Sah was acquitted.  Two appeals were thereafter filed by the convicted accused before the Patna High Court whereas the complainant also filed a revision against the acquittal of Raghunath Sah.  During the pendency of the appeal in the High Court, Dasrath Sah died.  The High Court, however, upheld the trial court judgment with respect to the three accused.  Gopal Sah accused then filed the present criminal appeal challenging his conviction and the matter has been put up for final hearing before us.  Bhushan Sah subsequently filed a special leave petition in this Court as well, but it is the admitted position that this matter has been dismissed by this Court on the ground of limitation as well as having no merit.  2.  The prosecution story is as under: 3.  Gopal Prasad Gupta deceased aged about 18 years went out of his house at about 6 p.m.  on 7th June 1982 and when he did not return till dinner time, his family members went in search for him but he could not be found.  The search continued the next morning as well 3 though without succesections At about 2 p.m.  on 8th June 1982 Murtaza Khan PW22 informed the family that Gopal Prasad Gupta's dead body was lying in a ditch near village Chhekabadh on which PW20 Jagdish Prasad Gupta, the uncle of the deceased lodged a FIR at about 30 p.m.  stating, inter-alia, that at about 6 p.m.  on the 7th of June 1982 the deceased had been seen with Raghunath Sah and his son Bhushan Sah near the wooden bridge.  During the course of the investigation, the accused were arrested and on their disclosure statements, a blood stained axe and a sickle allegedly used in the murder on 8th of September 1982 were recovered from a water filled pond.  The police also conducted a raid at the houses of the four accused and a blood stained ganji, a spade and a bucket were recovered from the house of Bhushan Sah and Raghunth Sah.  The statement of Dasrath Sah was also recorded under Section 164 of the Cr.  P.C.  by Judicial Magistrate, B.K.  Singh PW On the completion of the 4 investigation, the accused were charged as already indicated above.  4.  The prosecution examined 29 witnesses in all to support the circumstances appearing against the accused, as admittedly there was no eye witness to the murder.  PW1 Nageshwari Devi, the mother of the deceased deposed that on the relevant day her son had been taken away by Bhushan Sah for a walk and he had thereafter not returned.  PW3 Shivnath Sahu stated that he had seen Gopal Sah, the present appellant, in the orchard of Jai Narayan Sah carrying a sickle in his hand on the date of incident.  PW4 Sofil Khan and PW6 Digamber Mandal testified that they had seen Raghunath Sah carrying a spade and a bucket in his hand moving away hurriedly whereas PW5 Md.  Nadaf stated further that he had seen the three accused (Gopal Sah, Dasrath Sah and Bhushan Sah) moving away in a disturbed state of mind.  PW8 Kameshwar Choudhary too corroborated this statement and further added that he had seen the deceased along with Bhushan Sah and 5 Dasrath Sah near the wooden bridge and a third person whom he could not identify, was urinating close by.  He stated that man was not Gobind Gupta, a cousin of the deceased, who too, at one time, was suspected of the murder.  PW17 Lakhan Sah further stated that he had seen Gopal Parsad Gupta sitting near the bridge at about sun set with Bhushan Sah and Dasrath Sah accused.  The recoveries of the axe, sickle and other articles were sought to be proved by the evidence of PW9 Satyadeo Singh and PW12 mohd.  Arif.  The prosecution also produced in evidence PW16 Birendra Maharaj and PW19 Jagannath Choudhary to whom Dasrath accused had allegedly made an extra judicial confession of the involvement of all the accused in the murder.  5.  The trial court in its judgment held that the evidence of PW1, the mother of the deceased to the effect that the deceased had gone with Bhushan Sah on the evening of 7th June 1982 could not be relied upon in the light of the evidence of PW21 Binod Kumar, who stated that the deceased had gone with him on his cycle up to the water 6 tank.  The trial court also refused to rely on the confession made under section 164 of the Cr.  P.C.  by Dasrath, as it had not been recorded by following the correct procedure the more so as Dasrath Sah in the course of the trial had alleged that it had been made by him under coercion.  The trial court then went on to examine the other evidence.  It concluded that from the evidence of PW22 Murtuza Khan it had been established that the dead body of the deceased clad only in a ganji had been found near the orchard on 8th June 1982 at about 2 p.m.  The trial court relied upon the extra judicial confession made by Dasrath Sah and on the recovery of the sickle made at the instance of Gopal Sah and found corroboration from the fact that he had been seen rushing away from the place of incident.  The trial court concluded that the evidence supported the view that Bhushan Sah and Dasrath Sah had been seen near the bridge at about 6 p.m.  on 7th June 1982 whereas one unidentified person was urinating close by who could be Gopal Sah appellant.  The Court also 7 accepted the story that Bhushan Sah and Gopal Sah had disclosed to the police on 9th June, 1982 that they had thrown an axe and a sickle in the pond and the axe had been recovered on that day whereas the sickle had been recovered three months thereafter.  The High Court in appeal upheld the judgment of the trial court and dismissed both the appeals as well as the criminal revision filed by the complainant.  As already mentioned, the present appeal has been filed at the instance of Gopal Sah alone; and the special leave petition filed by Bhushan Sah has been dismissed on the ground of limitation as well as on merits.  6.  The learned counsel for the appellant has raised several arguments during the course of the hearing.  It has been pointed out that there was absolutely no evidence to connect Gopal Sah with the crime, as the recovery of the sickle made in September 1982 i.e.  about three months after the incident was too remote a factor.  It has also been pleaded that the evidence of last seen pertained only to Bhushan Sah and Dasrath Sah accused, as the 8 third person with them near the wooden bridge had not been identified as being Gopal Sah by any of the witnesses.  It has further been pleaded that the extra judicial confession allegedly made by Dasrath Sah could not be used as evidence against the other accused and that in any case this evidence too was unbelievable.  7.  The learned counsel for the respondent State has, however, argued that the appeal of Bhushan Sah having been dismissed on the same evidence, the present appeal too was liable to dismissal on that basis.  He has also pointed out that the recovery of the sickle and the statement of Dasrath Sah which was to be taken as an extra judicial confession completed the chain of events involving Gopal Sah in the murder.  8.  We have heard the learned counsel for the parties and gone through the record.  Admittedly, there are three main incriminating circumstances against the accused.  The first piece of evidence is the suggestion that the third person who was urinating close by the bridge was Gopal Sah, the second the extra judicial confession 9 made by Dasrath Sah and the third the recovery of alleged murder weapon - a sickle.  We are of the opinion that this evidence is, to say the least, unacceptable.  It has come in the statement of PW8 Kameshwar Choudhary that he had seen Dasrath Sah along with the deceased near the bridge and that another person was urinating close by.  It is the suggestion and inference that this person was Gopal Sah.  We are, however, of the opinion that there can be no conviction on inferences to be drawn from the prosecution evidence more particularly as there is absolutely no evidence to suggest that the third person was indeed Gopal Sah appellant.  We find that in this situation the statement of PW5 mohd.  Nadaf that he had seen the three convicted accused moving swiftly away from the direction of the site of the murder at about 30 p.m.  or that he had seen the appellant Gopal Sah with a sickle in hand is hardly sufficient to hold him guilty of murder.  We are, further, of the opinion that an extra judicial confession is, on the face of it, a weak piece of evidence and the 10 Courts are reluctant in the absence of a chain of cogent circumstances to rely on this evidence for the purpose of recording a conviction.  In any case, we find that the confession made by Dasrath Sah can, if at all, be used against him and not against his co-accused.  The statement of the investigating officer with respect to the place where the two murder weapons had been allegedly thrown makes the recovery itself tenuous.  Moreover, as the sickle allegedly in the hands of Gopal Sah had been recovered from a pond three months after the murder, no evidentiary value whatsoever can be attached to this circumstance as well.  9.  The argument of the State counsel that as the appeal of Bhushan Sah had been dismissed on merits, the appeal of Gopal Sah must meet the same fate must now be examined.  We observe that Bhushan Sah's appeal had been dismissed in limine on the ground of limitation as also on merit but we have chosen to hear the present appeal after leave had been granted by this Court long before Bhushan's special leave petition had been filed.  11 We, even otherwise, are of the opinion that the evidence involving Bhushan Sah is qualitatively and quantitatively different from the evidence against Gopal Sah, as would be apparent from the circumstances noted above, not only with respect to the last seen but also relating to the recovery of various items from his house which could be said to be relatable to the murder.  We must, therefore, conclude that the dismissal of the special leave petition of Bhushan Sah in limine, would not by itself be a ground to dismiss the appeal of Gopal Sah.", "statute": ["s3", "s2"]}, "1996.INSC.1350.txt": {"doc_url": "http://www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/1996/1350/.html", "explanation": {"Rama was killed in the house of Bal Kishan Dass": ["s2"], "her dead body was removed therefrom": ["s3"]}, "fact": " In the afternoon of March 14, 1982, Bal Kishan Dass, father-in-law of Rama, lodged a report (Ex. P.31) with the Kotwali (City) Police Station to the effect that she was missing from the house and in spite of their best efforts they were unable to trace her whereabouts. It was reported that Rama had retired for the night as usual but in the morning it was found that the main door of the house was wide open and she was not there. It was also reported that she was a victim cf occasional fits for which she was being treated. It was further mentioned that when she went to bed in the previous night she was wearing a red printed cotton saree, a sweater of orange colour, ear-rings, a neckchain, some glass-bangles of 'maroon' colour, two golden rings on the fingers, silver 'paizeb' on ankles and 'Bichwas' on toes. Along with the report, her photograph (Ex. P.33) was also handed over to the police. Before lodging the report Bal Kishan Dass had sent telegraphic message to Rama's father. Similar messages were also sent to Khamgaon in the State of Maharashtra where Suresh Narain, husband of Rama, was supposed to have gone in the night of March 10, 1982 to attend a marriage and other places where Suresh was expected to visit after attending the marriage. On getting information from Mahesh Narain, elder brother of Suresh, that Rama was missing Malti along with her husband Satish went to the house of Bal Kishan. She however was not satisfied with the explanation given by the mother-in-law of Rama about her disappearance. Returning therefrom she and her husband telephonically contacted Dr. sectionS. Rathi (P.W.12), a professor of Delhi University to whom Rama's another sister Sushma was married. Dr. Rathi was requested to inform Shri Kela at Kasganj also. On the following day (March 15, 1982) Shri Kela, Dr. Rathi and Kanti Chand (PW 34), elder brother of Rama, reached Saharanpur. Since Shri Kela was also not satisfied with the story of mysterious disappearance of Rama as given out by the members of her husband's family he lodged a report with the Saharanpur police station on the same day (Ex. P.161). Therein he stated that when he last met her she told him that she was being tortured by her in-laws. It was also stated in the report that earlier two of the daughters-in- law of bal Kishan Das had died under mysterious circumstances. Accordingly, Shri Kela asked the Station House Officer to make a proper investigation into the matter in the light of the information given by him. On March 16, 1982, Bal Kishan Dass met Shri M.S. Bali, the Addl. Superintendent of Police, Saharanpur and handed over to him an application (Ex. P.41) along with an 'Inland' letter (Ex. P.59), which he claimed to have received by post. The inland letter, which was addressed to Bal Kishan Dass by one Ahmed Hasan, gave the information that his son`s wife Smt. Rama was in his custody and that she would be sent back only after he was paid two lacs of rupees. He (Bal Kishan) was warned that any report to the Police and failure to pay the required ransom at the desired place by March 18, 1982 would cost the life of the kidnapped lady. The alleged abductor of Rama had asked him to enquire of his address from Bharat Steels, Dehradoon Chowk, Saharanpur. Shri Bali directed the Kotwali (City) Police Station to take necessary action in the matter. Since no action was taken by the Saharanpur police to trace out Rama her relatives decided to approach the higher authorities. Accordingly, Dr. Rathi held talks with his colleague Dr. K.S. Shukla (P.W.1l), Dean of Students Welfare in Delhi University and apprised him of the matter; and on March 24, 1982 along with others met the Minister of State for Home Affairs of the Government of India. After getting an assurance from the Minister that he would look into the matter when they were returning from the Parliament House they met some press reporters and gave them the news of Rama's missing. In the meantime, on March 17, 1982 at or about 00 A.M. when Kali Ram (P.W.5), a Sanitary Jamadar, along with his men was washing platform no. 1 of New Delhi Railway Station he found a green coloured hold-all lying abandoned and unclaimed near a bench in front of the II Class Ladies Waiting Room. When he tried to keep it aside he found it heavy and emitting bad smell. Suspecting some foul-play he sent information to the Police Head Constable Kartar Singh (P.W.2) of the Railway Police Station who, in his turn, informed Station House Officer (S.H.O. ) Ram Swaroop Yadav (P.W.38). On getting the information Shri Yadav rushed to the site of the hold-all along with other police personnel. On opening the hold-all he first found a large gunny bag (Art.4) tied with a rope (Art.15) beneath it another small gunny bag (Art.3) and then a gadda (Art.2). When the large gunny bag was opened a decomposed and swollen corpse of a woman aged about 25/26 years came out.

In addition thereto, there was loss of property worth several crores.  The Bombay police investigated the said matter at the initial stage, but subsequently the investigation of the same was entrusted to the Central Bureau of Investigation (hereinafter referred to as the CBI), and then upon conclusion of the investigation, a chargesheet was filed against a large number of accused persons.  Among the accused persons against whom a chargesheet was filed, 40 accused could not be put to trial as they were absconding.

Police charge-sheeted six persons including the appellants for those acts.  But the Sessions Court acquitted them all.  As the High Court reversed the order of acquittal as against the appellants and convicted them for murder they filed this appeal as of right under Section 379 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (for short the Code).  We heard detailed arguments of Shri Uday Umesh Lalit, Advocate for the appellants and Ms.  Anjali Doshi, Advocate for the State of Rajasthan.  Munshi Singh was an advocates clerk who was murdered in the vicinity of his own house by using a pistol and other lethal weapons at about 7 P.M.  on The prosecution case is the following: Appeallnt Hukam Singh (who was ranked as A.1 in the trial court) and his brother Harnam Singh (A.5) and the latters sons Jaswant Singh (A.2) and Balwant Singh (A.4) had some axe to grind against deceased Munshi Singh.  On the evening of the fateful day Munshi Singh alighted from a bus near his house and was proceeding to his house.  His son Bhupender Pal (PW.4) took over a bag of cattle-feed which his father brought from the bazar and he too was walking a little ahead of his father.  All the appellants were at the bus stop variously armed.  On sighting the deceased one among the appellants (Hukam Singh) made an exhortation to finish him off and then Darshan Singh (who died before the trial started) fired his pistol which hit the deceased on his back.  He slumped down on the spot.  Seeing the above mishap befallen his father PW.4 Bhupender Pal rushed to rescue him.  Munshi Singhs wife on hearing the commotion flew down from her house and reached her husband.  All the accused assaulted both of them as well as the deceased.  Then the assailants dragged the deceased along the ground and brought him to their courtyard.  They made a pyre with firewood splinters and put the body of Munshi Singh on it and set it ablaze while his wife and son were looking on aghast.  The police was alerted and they reached the spot but to find only the burnt remaining of Munshi Singh and the smouldering embers of the dying pyre.  They extinguished the flames and salvaged whatever remained on the corpse.  A team of doctors conducted post-mortem examination among whom PW.8 Dr.  Rajendra Kumar gave evidence that the dead body reached such a stage of burnt condition that it was impossible to form an opinion regarding the cause of death.  However, they recovered a metallic substance from the skeleton which could be the embedded remnant of firing the pistol.  Hukam Singh, when examined by the Sessions Judge under Section 313 of the Code admitted that he killed the deceased.  But he advanced a contrary version like this: He and Darshan Singh saw the deceased grappling Bharama Bai and the lady was crying.  Then Darshan Singh fired at the molesting Minshi Singh.  When his son Bhupender Pal (PW.4) and his wife Ram Pyari(PW.5) reached the spot Hukam Singh and his associates forcibly prevented them from removing Munshi Singh from the spot.  He also admitted that the dead body of Munshi Singh was subsequently cremated by them.  Neither the Sessions Court nor the High Court found the said version of Hukam Singh to be true.  He did not care to examine Bharama Bai nor make any attempt to substantiate the version put forward by him.  The courts therefore did not attach any credence to the aforesaid belated version put-forth by Hukam Singh at the fag end of the trial.  Bhupender Pal (PW.4) and Ram Pyari (PW.5) were the two eyewitnesses examined by the prosecution.  The fact that they were present at the scene of occurrence could not be disputed nor the same has been disputed by the accused.  They sustained injuries at the hands of the assailants and the doctor who noted such injuries had testified about them in the court as PW.  The version spoken to by PW-4 in court is substantially a reiteration of the version which he supplied to the police as early as 40 P.M.  on the same night.  That became the basis for the FIR.  The Sessions Court refused to believe the testimony of those witnesses on the erroneous perception that they are interested witnesses.  The only premise for dubbing them as interested witnesses is that they were the kith and kin of the deceased.  Why should such witnesses be termed as interested witnesses? If they had seen the occurrence they would certainly have the interest to bring the offenders of the murder of their breadwinner to book.  Normally the kith and kin of the deceased, if they had seen the occurrence would not absolve the real offenders and involve innocent persons for that murder.  [Vide Dalip Singh vs State of Punjab [[1953] INSC 42](http://www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/1953/html); [(1954 SCR 145 )](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1954%20SCR%20145), Guli Chand vs State of Rajasthan 4 SCC 158)].  Be that as it may, the promptitude with which the First Information Statement was lodged as done by PW.4 in this case, give such an assurance that he would have told the police the true version of the incident.  In the First Information Statement PW.4 mentioned that one Inder Singh and one Budh Ram Nayak have also seen the incident.  The Investigating Officer included those two persons as witnesses to the occurrence when the final report was laid.  But in the Sessions Court they were not examined by the Public Prosecutor.  The Sessions Judge frowned at the prosecution for not examining those witnesses.  The High Court noted that non-examination of those witnesses was due to an application submitted by the Public Prosecutor that those two witnesses did not support the prosecution version.  Regarding that aspect learned Judges of the High Court made the following observations: In our opinion, it is the discretion of the Public Prosecutor to examine the witnesses, whom he likes.  It is not necessary for the prosecution to examine each and every witness to prove a particular fact.  When the Public Prosecutor came to know that Inder Singh and Budh Ram would not depose in favour of the prosecution, he was justified in giving them up by moving an application in the court that the witness had joined hands with the accused.  There was nothing wrong in the conduct of the Public Prosecutor.  The fact that the two witnesses have not been examined, does not detract the testimony of Ram Pyari and Bhupender Pal.  Shri Uday Umesh Lalit, learned counsel for the appellants made a criticism against the Public Prosecutor for not examining those two witnesses, as they were the only independent witnesses.  Learned counsel contended that the Public Prosecutor can not withhold the evidence of such independent witnesses in a case of this nature as the remaining witnesses were the close relatives of the deceased person.  The discretion of the Public Prosecutor in choosing the witnesses for examination cannot include the freedom to keep away such independent witnesses from being examined, argued the counsel.  On the other hand, Ms.  Anjali Doshi, learned counsel who argued for the State, submitted that the Public Prosecutor did not commit any impropriety in not examining those two witnesses.  When he learnt that those two witnesses would speak against the prosecution version he sidestepped them and it is the prerogative of the Public Prosecutor not to examine such persons as prosecution witnesses; it is open to the Public Prosecutor to report to the court about his decision not to examine any person as prosecution witnesses particularly when he got report through his own sources that those witnesses were won over by the accused, according to the learned counsel for the State.  In trials before a Court of Sessions the prosecution shall be conduced by a Public Prosecutor.  Section 226 of the Code enjoins on him to open up his case by describing the charge brought against the accused.  He has to state what evidence he proposes to adduce for proving the guilt of the accused.  If he knew at that stage itself that certain persons cited by the investigating agency as witnesses might not support the prosecution case he is at liberty to state before the court that fact.  Alternatively, he can wait further and obtain direct information about the version which any particular witness might speak in court.  If that version is not in support of the prosecution case it would be unreasonable to insist on the Public Prosecutor to examine those persons as witnesses for prosecution.  When the case reaches the stage envisaged in Section 231 of the Code the Sessions Judge is obliged to take all such evidence as may be produced in support of the prosecution.  It is clear from the said Section that the Public Prosecutor is expected to produce evidence in support of the prosecution and not in derogation of the prosecution case.  At the said stage the Public Prosecutor would be in a position to take a decision as to which among the persons cited are to be examined.  If there are too many witnesses on the same point the Public Prosecutor is at liberty to choose two or some among them alone so that the time of the court can be saved from repetitious depositions on the same factual aspects.  That principle applies when there are too many witnesses cited if they all had sustained injuries at the occurrence.  The Public Prosecutor in such cases is not obliged to examine all the injured witnesses.  If he is satisfied by examining any two or three of them, it is open to him to inform the court that he does not propose to examine the remaining persons in that category.  This will help not only the prosecution for relieving itself of the strain of adducing repetitive evidence on the same point but also helps the court considerably in lessening the workload.  Time has come to make every effort possible to lessen the workload, particularly those courts crammed with cases, but without impairing the cause of justice.  The situation in a case where the prosecution cited two categories of witnesses to the occurrence, one consisting of persons closely related to the victim and the other consisting of witnesses who have no such relation, the Public Prosecutors duty to the court may require him to produce witnesses from the latter category also subject to his discretion to limit to one or two among them.  But if the Public Prosecutor got reliable information that any one among that category would not support the prosecution version he is free to state in court about that fact and skip that witness being examined as a prosecution witnesections It is open to the defence to cite him and examine him as defence witnesections The decision in this regard has to be taken by the Public Prosecutor in a fair manner.  He can interview the witness before hand to enable him to know well in advance the stand which that particular person would be adopting when examined as a witness in court.", "statute": ["s3", "s2"]}, "2006.INSC.24.txt": {"doc_url": "http://www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/2006/24/.html", "explanation": {"wherein one Kallu was Ram resident of Village Rampura murdered.": ["s3"], "This is to be seen from the evidence whether the case against the accused is made up malafidely or not.": ["s2"]}, "fact": " STATE OF HARYANA [2006] INSC 24 (17 January 2006) sectionB.  Sinha & P.K.  Balasubramanyan [Arising out of SLP (Crl.  ) no.  4709 of 2005] sectionB.  SINHA, J : Leave granted.  The Appellant along with one Umrao Singh was convicted for commission of an offence purported to be under Section 12 of the Prevention of Corruption Act (for short \"the Act\") and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of one year and to pay a fine of rs.  3000/- each.  On an appeal preferred thereagainst the High Court, however, reduced the sentence to six months as against the Appellant and the sentence awarded to Umrao Singh was reduced to the period already undergone.  The fact of the matter is as under: One Ganeshi Lal, Inspector (PW-2) was investigating the case under Section 302/201 of the Indian Indian Penal Code, 1860, 1860 arising out the First Information Report no.  45 dated 1992 wherein one Kallu was Ram resident of Village Rampura murdered.  Allegedly, Umrao Singh and his family members were suspected to be involved in the said case.  The prosecution case is that on 1992 when Ganeshi Lal, Inspector was present at about 7 a.m.  at his residence, the Appellant and the said Umrao Singh came to his house and offered him a sum of rs.  10,000/- with a request that he should help them in connection therewith.  Ganeshi Lal allegedly refused to accept the money stating that he was not in a position to help them but on their insistence he accepted the same in presence of Head Constables Mahabir (PW-3) and Abdul Subhan Khan (Not examined).  He allegedly sealed the same in a parcel and prepared a memo on the basis of which a First Information Report was recorded by one Nathu Ram, Inspector, Police Station Narnaul.  The Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP), Headquarter thereafter came to his residence, recorded the statement of the witnesses and took into possession the said sealed parcel.  Upon investigation, the Appellant with Umrao Singh were charged under Section 12 of the Act.  Upon completion of the investigation, a chargesheet was filed and the Appellant and the said Umrao Singh were put on trial.  The case of the defence, however, was that in connection with the aforementioned murder of Kallu Ram, as some of their relatives were accused, they came to court.  They were carrying more than rs.  10,000/- with them.  The complainant snatched the said amount from their hands and when threatened by them that if they would not receive back the amount, the matter would be reported to the higher-ups, the aforementioned false case was thrust upon them.  Mr.  Uday Umesh Lalit, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the Appellant, took us through the evidences of the prosecution witnesses and submitted: (i) There is a delay in lodging of the First Information Report.  (ii) The prosecution witnesses have contradicted themselves as regard mode and manner of the sealing of the parcel.  (iii) There was no reason as to why the DSP should have come to the place of occurrence at about 30 a.m.  only i.e.  after more than four and half hours.  (iv) In view of the discrepancies in the statements of the prosecution witnesses, the defence version cannot be said to be wholly improbable.  Mr.  Rajeev Gaur Naseem, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the State, on the other hand, submitted that the delay in lodging the First Information Report cannot itself be a ground to throw away the entire prosecution case.  The learned counsel submitted that prosecution case has satisfactorily been proved in view of the evidences adduced on behalf of the prosecution.  The prosecution in support of its case examined three witnesses.  Ganeshi Lal (PW-2) is the complainant.  According to him, after accepting the money, he prepared a sealed parcel bearing the seal of GLY.  He further stated that the DSP, Shri Jagwant Singh (PW-4) came to his residence and recorded the statement of other witnesses and also recorded his supplementary statement.  The DSP further took into possession the sealed parcel containing currency notes.  In his cross-examination, he, however, could not give details about the principal suspects in the aforementioned murder of Kallu Ram.  He also could not say how many suspected persons he had interrogated and how many of them were called by him in connection therewith.  Even he could not give the number of such suspects interrogated and detained by him.  He accepted that Sham Singh, son of the deceased was chargesheeted in the said case.  He further accepted that although he had interrogated Umrao Singh and his relations in the presence of villagers, it did not give rise to any suspicion against them as otherwise he would have arrested them.  He accepted that the Appellant had met him earlier.  He further admitted that the DSP came around 30 a.m.  and till then allegedly everybody remained at the spot.  The accused persons were not arrested by him but according to him were arrested by the DSP.  The DSP remained at the spot upto 30 p.m.  Admittedly, the DSP did not sign the sealed packet.  The Police Station, Narnaul was at a distance of only 50 yards from his residence and office of CIA was at a distance of two kms.  from bus stand Narnaul.  It has further been accepted that no entries about the coming and going of the prosecution witnesses were made in roznamcha in CIA.  PW-3 is a Head Constable.  He alleged: \"Inspector said that giving bribe as an offence and they said that he would do justice.  Then he took the currency notes into possession after turning it into a sealed parcel vide memo exhibit PB.  I signed the memo.  Then Inspector wrote a rukka and sent Abdul Subhan Khan to the sectionP.  Office.  Abdul Khan returned after giving the rukka in the sectionP.  Office.  Thereafter, DSP headquarter came there.  He recorded our statements, took the sealed parcel containing notes vide recovery memo exhibit PD.  \" In his cross- examination, he accepted that there was a telephone in the policeline and also in the police station.  He further admitted that he had not made entry in the roznamcha regarding his visit to the house of Inspector Ganeshi Lal.  He had also not made any entry after his return to the police station.  He further stated: \"The DSP had taken the parcel into possession after thoroughly checking it and counting it, and he put GLY seal again on it.  The DSP remained at the spot for a period of about 5-6 hours, i.e.  , upto 15 p.m.  or so\" If the DSP had come to the place of occurrence at about 30 and left at about 30 p.m.  evidently he did not remain at the place of occurrence for a period of six hours.  PW-4 is the DSP.  According to him, he only took into possession of sealed parcel containing rs.  10,000/-.  In his cross-examination, he accepted that he did not record the statement of Inspector, Ganeshi Lal nor did he feel the necessity of re-verifying the investigation done by Ganeshi Lal because he had already recorded the statement of other five witnesses and interrogated the accused.  If Ganeshi Lal was the complainant, ordinarily his statement should have been taken.  He further stated: \"I did not feel it necessary to ask the purpose from the witnesses Abdul Khan and Mahabir nor did I check their departure from the roznamcha of CIA staff.  I believed whatever they told that they have come for some official work.  I correctly recorded the statements of Abdul Subhan Khan and Mahabir including marked portion A to A of exhibit DA.  I cannot explain the omission\" There was, thus, even no proper investigation.  The learned Special Judge in his judgment noticed that the First Information Report was recorded around 11 O'Clock and it reached the Court of Chief Judicial Magistrate after three and half hours.  The learned Special Judge, as regard the correctness of the defence, surmised: \"As we know, in India, every officer particularly Police Officers are taken with doubtful eyes, in the public works.  But, it cannot be said that in every case, the police had acted malafidely.  This is to be seen from the evidence whether the case against the accused is made up malafidely or not.  As both the accused were suspected in murder case.  It is possible for any person who suspected in a criminal case to approach the police officer with the money to scare him away from the police challan.  As it is known to every person that police officials are not honest.  Even the other officials or officers are not honest what to talk of police officers.  Alike it, general public at large cannot be said to be so honest and the said persons can approach the police officers or officials.  This is how the accused might have reached in the office of Inspector Ganeshi Lal with the money.  The persons living in India particularly in Northern India have become so much daring that they can come to the officers or officials and they can offier the bribe in the presence of other officials.  Head Constable is nothing but a straw as against Inspector Ganeshi Lal because he is always under the thumb of Inspector.  I had seen the Inspector in the court while he had appeared in the court as a witnesections Though, he was dressed properly but it cannot be said that inspector was habitual in accepting the bribe.", "statute": ["s3", "s2"]}, "1998.INSC.357.txt": {"doc_url": "http://www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/1998/357/.html", "explanation": {"all the 3 accused mercilessly beat her and threw her dead body on the pavement outside their residential building.": ["s3"], "threw her dead body on the pavement outside their residential building.": ["s2"], "they took the dead body to the hospital and reported to the hospital authorities that she had jumped from 11th floor of their house and had received injuries as a result of the fall.": ["s2"], "the accused had thrown the dead body of Neelam on the payment and after few minutes had taken it in a car to the hospital.": ["s2"]}, "fact": " Neelam and married Virender Kumar Jain about 4 months before the date of the incident which took place on The prosecution case was that soon after the marriage, particularly the mother-in-law and her husband started harassing and torturing her as proper amount of dowry was not paid.

The compensation of rs.50,000/- awarded to Girijabai (PW-4) was reduced to rs.20,000/-.  The present appeal is by A1, A6 and A 2.  Seven accused persons had faced trial for alleged commission of offences punishable under Sections 143, 148, 341, 109, 302 and Section 201 read with Section 149 of the Indian Indian Penal Code, 1860, 1860, 1860 (in short the `Indian Penal Code, 1860').  The occurrence took place in the intervening night of 2005 around midnight.  3.  Prosecution version in a nutshell is as follows: Namadev Muralidhar Huvvannavar (the deceased) resided in Bommanabudni village along with his wife-Girijabai (PW.1) and his five children, out of whom Panduranga (PW.5) is one.  He was in politics and due to his activities, he had incurred enmity of many persons.  He was an accused in a session case on the allegation of having committed about ten years prior to 2005, the murder of Arjunappa Yaraddi (father of accused no.4) having set on fire the sugarcane crop of Yallappa Yaraddi.  He was later acquitted in the said case.  Due to that, he had enmity towards accused no.4, and for certain other reasons towards other accused also.  On 2005 he left for Mudhol at about 00 p.m.  , on his CD Don motorcycle bearing Reg.  No.  KA- 48/E-1688 (M.15).  In Mudhol, he met Kallanagouda Timmanagouda Patil of Utturu (P.W.12) at about 00 p.m.  , and told that he was returning to Bommanabudni via Halki.  Later at 00 p.m.  he was seen at Halki by 2 Gyaneshwar Ramappa Manemmi (P.W.11) going on the motorcycle towards Bommanbudni.  He did not return home on that day and on the next day as well.  Therefore, Girijabai (P.W.1) and Panduranga.  (P-W.5) started the search for help.  They traced the movement of Namadev till he left Halki and thereafter they could not get any trace of Namadev.  In the meantime, they learnt that there were certain motorcycle marks in the land of Vijaya Mandandappa Sutar of Mingapura and when they went there, they found certain tyre marks of a motor cycle corresponding with the tyre marks of Namadev's motor cycle.  Therefore suspecting possible abduction of Namadev, P.W.1 lodged a complaint against Yallappa Arjunappa Yaraddi (accused no.4) and Vital Kalakappa Navi (accused no.5).  That complaint was received by Sri Malakappa, P.S.I.  of Lokapur Police Station (P.W.21), who registered a case at Crime no.16/2005 and forwarded F.I.R.  (Ex.  P.27) to the JMFC, Mudhol.  He went to the place i.e.  , the land of Vijaya Manadappa Sutar as shown by P.W.1 and conducted the spot mahazar as per exhibitP.  He also collected information in the neighbouring villages.  He learnt that on that night i.e.  , at 00 p.m.  of 2005, P.W.10-Vishnu Tulasigeri had seen the accused Nos.1, 2 and 4 to 7 near Bommanabudni bus stand talking to each other and later P.W.16-Laxmappa Mullauru having seen the accused no.2 and 7 going on one motor cycle and accused Nos.1 and 6 3 going on another motor cycle towards Belgaum road.  He also learnt that at that time the accused no.7 was on the motorcycle with a gunny bag and when P.W.16 had asked him about the same, the accused no.7 had replied that it contained a jaggery block intended to be given to his relative.  The police also learnt that on the same night i.e.  , at about 00 a.m.  on 2005, the accused Nos.1, 2, 6 and 7 had been seen by P.W.7-Hanamath Gouda Patil near the canal and two motor cycles parked on the road.  That was further confirmed by the information given by P.W.8-Bhimappa Maleguddi.  In furtherance of the same, the police suspected the accused Nos.1, 2 6 and 7 in the matter and launched a search for them.  The accused Nos.1 and 2 were apprehended on On interrogation by P.W.20-Basavareddi Lingadal, C.P.I.  of Mudhol circle (investigating officer), the accused Nos.1 and 2 volunteered information to show the place where Namadev had been murdered and also the place where his dead body had been buried.  In furtherance of that information, police officer in-charge went to the place near the land of Vijaya Manandappa Sutar and later to a place as shown by accused Nos.1 and There the place near the canal shown by the accused Nos.1 and 2 was dug up resulting in the discovery of a gunny bag (M.9), which contained a dead body.  That dead body was identified by Namadeva's wife-P.W.1-Smt.  Girijabai and Namadev's son-Sri Pandurganga (P.W.5) as 4 that of Namadeva.  In furtherance of the information furnished by the accused Nos.1 and 2 regarding involvement of other accused, a search was launched and accused Nos.4 and 5 were arrested on In furtherance of the voluntary information furnished by them, sticks M.Os.11 and 12 allegedly used by them to beat Namadev were recovered.

A swimmer-Lavappa Laxmappa Nagaral (P.W.15) was sent to that place, who brought up the said motorcycle (M.13).  That was recovered under panchanama.  Later the accused no.7 was arrested on 2005 at Panchagavi village and in furtherance of the information furnished by him, the pick-axe (M.14) allegedly used for burying the dead body was recovered.  After further investigation, a charge sheet was placed against the accused.  The accused pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.  The prosecution examined 23 witnesses and closed its case.  About the deceased having been seen by the persons for the last time, the prosecution examined the deceased's wife (PW.1), the deceased's son (P.W.5) and P.W.s 10, 11 and About the movements of the accused to connect 5 them with the murder of Namadev, prosecution has examined P.Ws.10, 13 and Though P.W.13 has not supported the prosecution and P.W.16 only partially supported, the evidence of these two witnesses shows the movement of the accused Nos.  1, 2, 6 and 7.  As regards the motive for murder, P.Ws 6, 17 and 18 have been examined.  P.Ws.  2, 3 and 4 are panchas.

According to the prosecution, extra judicial confession had been made by the accused before P.W.9 and the drowned motorcycle was recovered after P.W.15 went down into the river and brought up the motorcycle.  P.W.18 is the junior engineer, who has drawn the sketch of scene of the offence.  Post mortem examination on the dead body was done by P.W.19 doctor.  P.Ws.  20 to 23 are police officers.  The trial Court on the basis of the cumulative effect of the circumstantial evidence concluded that the prosecution had proved that it was the accused who had committed the murder of Namadev and had disposed of the dead body by putting it in a gunny bag and burying it near the canal of Chickakhandi village and throwing motor cycle in the river.  In appeal, conviction of A-3 to A-5 was set aside as noted above.  A-6 and A-7 were acquitted of all charges relating to Section 302 and 109 read with Section 149 Indian Penal Code, 1860.  The conviction of A-1 and A-3 under Sections 302 and 6 109 read with Section 149 Indian Penal Code, 1860 was converted to Section 302 read with Section 34 Indian Penal Code, 1860.

He came back to his home after about one hour but again he went back to the house of P.W. 1 to collect his inkpot which he by mistake left there. Sandeep did not return to his home till about 00 p.m. P.W.3, P.W.4 and other family members in the company of neighbourers proceeded in search of Sandeep but he could not be traced anywhere. P.W. 4 at 45 p.m. lodged a missing report of Sandeep at Police Out-post. Sub-Inspector Jeet Singh (P.W.8) along with three Constables immediately reached Gol Market. They cordoned the area and initiated search of Sandeep throughout the night in the market and nearby places. According to the prosecution, the accused had cordial and friendly relations with P.W. 3 being a neighbourer, but he did not show any interest for searching the missing boy. It was alleged that in the morning of 1979, the accused was seen present in his quarter by Gopal Krishna (not produced), brother of P.W. 3 and P.W. Gopal Krishna asked the accused whether he had seen Sandeep anywhere in the vicinity, but the accused did not utter any word and on the contrary, he got upset and quietly went inside his quarter. After sometime, Rajendra Kumar (P.W.2) noticed the accused locking the door of his quarter and going out. It was alleged that on 1979 at about 00 a.m. , P.W. 3 - father of Sandeep, received a call on his telephone from Dehradun. The caller demanded a ransom of rs.20,000/- for returning his son, Sandeep. Finally, the deal was settled for rs.12,000/-. P.W. 3 was asked by the caller to keep money near Bindal Bridge, Dehradun, on the same night at 00 p.m. It was alleged that the voice of the caller appeared somewhat like that of the appellant. P.W.8 the Sub Inspector Jeet Singh advised P.W. 3 to keep the amount as demanded by the caller at the appointed time and place under watch and control of the police so that the police could apprehend the culprit. According to the settled plan, P.W. 3 left the money at the place as directed, but it appeared that the culprit some how got information of the presence of the police so he did not turn up till midnight to collect the ransom amount. Finally, P.W. 3 and the police party decided to go back to Dak Pathhar as there was no useful purpose of waiting at that place. It was in the forenoon of 1979 at about 45 p.m. when P.W. 4, Jagdish Prasad (P.W. 9), a shop keeper in the neighbourhood of P.W. 3 and P.W. 8 along with police constables and other residents of the area were on the look out of Sandeep near a place known as Khadar, they noticed the accused coming from the opposite side of Gol Market. On seeing the police party and other persons, the accused tried to run away, but he was over- powered by the members of the search party. On interrogation by P.W. 8, the Investigating Officer, the accused disclosed that he had dumped the dead body of Sandeep in his quarter and the same could be recovered by him. Pursuant to the information supplied by the appellant, the Investigating Officer recorded the said information in writing marked as Exhibit Ka-28 in the case diary. The accused was arrested at Gol Market on the spot and was taken to his quarter. The Investigating Officer asked the accused to handover the keys of the lock of the outer door of the quarter but he replied that he had lost the keys. The Investigating Officer was left with no other option except to get the locks of the outer door and also the lock of the other door of the inner room of the quarter broken up in the presence of witnesses. On entering the inner room of the quarter, the accused opened a tin box in which dead body of Sandeep was found lying. The dead body was removed from the box and on visual examination marks of strangulation were noticed on the neck of the deceased. The Investigating Officer recorded the First Information Report under Sections 302/201 Indian Penal Code, 1860 on 1979 at 15 p.m. against the accused and held necessary mazhar on the spot. The neck and knee of the deceased were found tied with a piece of cloth when the dead body was removed from the tin box.

The marriage was to be performed at 30 a.m. The elders and relatives of both the sides had gathered to attend the marriage. However, PW-16 Nagesh Gowda with whom the deceased was supposed to marry did not turn up. The elders and relatives who had come to attend the marriage raised serious concern as the father of the bride PW-6 and other relatives were visibly humiliated. At this stage, it appears that to save the family from humiliation, the elders and relatives of PW-6, who had come to attend the marriage, decided that the marriage of the deceased-Kamalamma should take place. According to the prosecution story, it is at that stage that A-1 had come forward to get married with the deceased on the condition that dowry of rs.10000/- and three sovereigns of gold be paid to him. It is the further case of the prosecution that A-1 also put a condition that once the payment was made he was prepared to get married with the deceased on the same day. As PW-6 father of the deceased was helpless in arranging the amount of dowry and three sovereigns of gold, the elders and relatives who had come to attend the marriage, contributed their mite and collected rs.8000/- and the same was paid to the accused. It was also agreed upon that the remaining sum of rs.2000/- and three sovereigns of gold would be given after harvesting the crop by PW- Having resolved the demand of dowry, as aforesaid, ultimately the marriage took place on the same day at about 30 p.m. According to PW-9 on 1987, the deceased- Kamalamma and her sister had slept in one room in the house of the accused. All other accused and father- in-law and her husband were sleeping in another room. On the next day, early in the morning at about 00 am i.e. 1987 she got up and found that the deceased-Kamalamma was not there. She prepared coffee but the deceased did not turn up. Then she informed the husband of the deceased and mother-in-law. According to the prosecution story, the deceased had gone to the bath-room and set fire for warm water. At that time A-1 was abusing his wife. There is a small window through which PW-9 could see what was going on in the bathroom. On hearing the abusive language she went there to see what was happening there. There she saw, through a small window, that A-1 had hit the deceased on her head with MO 11 ( axe ) with all his might. The deceased- Kamalamma fell down at the stone in the bathroom unconsciously. Then again A-1 assaulted on her head. Due to heavy blow there was a lot of bleeding and the blood spread on that stone. Thereafter, she went and woke her mother-in-law A- As she also got up, PW-9 showed all that to her who also saw it through that window. Thereafter A-2 and A-3 went to the bathroom and all were talking that Kamalamma was no more. A-1 was also threatening that this should not be disclosed to anyone. Thereafter A-1 asked A-3 to bring battery from inside. Thereafter A-1 bodily lifted the dead body of his wife and went outside. A-3 was putting the torch and A-2 also followed them. PW-9, being terrified and panicky, woke up her husband and showed the blood in the bathroom. Her husband also got very much afraid and he did not go outside. Thereafter, she went to answer the second call of nature. By that time she learnt that A-1 and A-3 had come back to the house. The blood was washed out with water. The other inmates of the house were told that they should tell on inquiry by the police or anyone else that the deceased - Kamalamma had died as she fell into the well while returning from the other well from where they were to bring water.", "statute": ["s3", "s2"]}, "2011.INSC.115.txt": {"doc_url": "http://www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/2011/115/.html", "explanation": {"Samara Tirkey is said to have raised his hand towards Jayaram when accused Megha Tirkey dealt a lathi blow on the head of Samara Tirkey whereby he fell down.
