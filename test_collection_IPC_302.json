A day later, he indulged in the ghastly attack against the entire family. The crucial evidence on behalf of the prosecution is that of PW 1 Smt. Rama Khanna who gave the first information report to the police soon after the occurrence. The prosecution case as unfolded by her deposition is this :  The accused was residing in the servant's quarter, he having been employed about six months prior to the incident. There were instances in which the accused proved to be unreliable. He had stolen money from the purse of her husband once when she and her husband went to outstation. He killed her pet sparrow and also put feathers inside the nose of her hen. She and her husband discussed about the conduct and mentality of the accused and decided to dispense with his service from 1st December, 1994. To this effect her husband informed the accused. On 14.11.1994, the accused served bed tea at about 8 A.M. to her, her husband and her sister. At that time her son was sleeping in the bed room. After the bed tea, her husband left the house for a morning walk as usual. PW 1 and her sister went into the bath rooms adjacent to each other. When she wanted to come out of the bath room, PW 1 found it was bolted from outside. From the window of the bath room, she communicated to her sister to open the bolt. As her sister just came out of the bath room, PW 1 heard her cries for about five minutes and then there was pin drop silence. At this PW 1 became suspicious that some untoward incident had happened. Then, the accused himself opened the bath room door in which PW 1 was confined; but, before fully opening the door and confronting the accused, she noticed that the accused was holding chilly powder in one hand and sword in another. The sword happened to be of her husband. As soon as the door was opened, the accused threw chilly powder on her and attacked with the sword. The sword luckily hit the golden bangle which she was wearing as a result of which her left wrist was fractured and in this process, the bangle got dented. She managed to get into the bathroom and bolted the door from inside. The accused kept banging the bath room door. At that juncture, her husband returned from morning walk and on hearing her panicky voice from the bathroom, he came straight to the bed room to which the bathroom was attached. She pleaded with her husband to open the door as the accused Raja (alias name of accused) was upto some mischief. Her husband replied that Raja was not there, but immediately thereafter, she heard the cries of her husband as the accused started attacking him with sword after throwing chilly powder on his face. She heard her husband remarking Raja \"why are you doing this? We have not harmed you\". After sometime, the cries of her husband subsided. Thereafter, the accused tried to injure her with the help of a danda from the window of the bathroom. In the meanwhile, her husband gathered strength to open the bathroom door from outside. Then PW 1 ran towards the main gate of the house and closed it from inside to prevent re-entry of the accused inside the house as he was standing outside at that time. At this, the accused started banging the main door repeatedly and thereafter left the spot. When she came inside the bed room, she found that her husband was lying injured with profuse bleeding and heavy breathing. She noticed the injuries on his neck and chilly powder smeared on his face. Then she rushed to the bed room of her son and found that he was lying dead in a pool of blood with his neck severed from his body. A stone slab was found on his legs. On entry into the room of her sister, PW 1 found that chilly powder was spilled all over the room and her sister was dead with severe injuries on her face and neck. On opening the drawing room window, she found Jamadar Raju (PW 4) approaching the house. She cried out and asked him to open the main gate and told him that the accused had murdered the inmates of the house. Then the neighbours gathered and took her and her injured husband to ONGC hospital. He was declared dead at the hospital. PW 1 was given first aid and then she was dropped back at the house. PW 8 who was known to the family of PW 1 was in the crowd and he scribed the complaint as per her dictation. She handed over the report at Vasant Vihar Police post at about 10.30 A.M. The police then inspected the place of occurrence, took photographs and sent the dead body for post-mortem. Again, PW 1 was taken to ONGC hospital and x-ray of her wrist was taken and she was treated for her fracture.

At about 00 p.m. the three appellants together proceeded to a glade situate near a jungle where deceased Tara Chand was working and showered blows on him with gandasi and chhura (both cutting weapons). The victim made a loud cry which attracted the attention of some people in the proximity who rushed to the spot, but in the meanwhile the assailants took to their heels towards the jungles. Those who reached the spot found Tara Chand lying dead in a pool of blood. As there was no eye-witness for the murder, the prosecution had to rest on circumstances alone for proving that appellants have murdered Tara Chand. Sessions Court and the High Court found, in one accord, that the circumstances have concatenated into a complete chain pointing unerringly to the complicity of the appellants in the murder of Tara Chand. There was no dispute that Tara Chand was murdered on the evening of 1990 at the place of occurrence mentioned by the prosecution. The post-mortem examination conducted on the body of Tara Chand revealed that he had a number of incised injuries, fracture, of ribs, and some stab wounds. One of the stab injuries had penetrated into the abdominal cavity. Another stab wound plunging through the second and third intercoastal space (right side) had caused a cut on the peritoneum. It is clear that deceased was the victim of a murderous attack inflicting many blows with cutting weapons. The main circumstance found by the two Courts are the following: (1) appellants were sore with Tara Chand for his role as goonda of Jai Paul, (2) The three appellants were found proceeding towards the place of occurrence just a few minutes before the occurrence. PW 6-A (a clerk attached to the post office of Nahan) saw the three appellants during the evening and later PW-6A heard about the murder of Tara Chand; (3 PW4 a boy aged 13 saw the appellants sitting on the open field near the place of occurrence at about 30 p.m. and a few minutes later PW4 heard a cry \"Hai Ram mar diya\" (Oh Go, I am killed); (4) PW2 Ram Singh heard the same cry from near the place of occurrence and the witness ran to the spot and saw the three appellants running towards jungle area and Tara Chand lying dead in a pool of blood; (5)A1 - Raj Mohammad told the investigating officer, during interrogation, that he had concealed a gandasi inside the bush.

After death of Pratap, his widow Surjit sold it to accused Surat Singh, Balwant Singh and Dola Ram, who are all sons of accused Chhajju Ram.

In the early morning of he fateful day Prabhu along with Bir Singh and Suraj Bhan went to plough the aforesaid land; and at or about 8 A.M.

Reaching there Surat Singh raised a Jalkara that they would exterminate Prabhu and his companions as they were ploughing the land purchased by them. To this Prabhu retorted that it was his ancestral land and he was in its possession for long. Hearing this Smt. Chameli took out stones and chilli powder from her bag and started throwing the same towards the three deceased. Smt. Giarsi also threw stones which she was carrying in her hands. All the other accused persons then started beating the three deceased with their respective weapons as a result of which they fell down. Finding Satbir (P.W.7) and Harbilas (P.W.9) of their village, who had by then reached there while in search of the missing buffalo of the latter, and Raj Kumari (P.W.10) present there, the above accused persons asked them to leave the place; and out of fear they took shelter behind a cluster of bushes nearby wherefrom they saw that they were still beating the three deceased. Soon thereafter the appellants fled away along with their weapons. After they had gone, the above three witnesses returned to the place of occurrence and found that all the three victims had succumbed to their injuries. Harbilas (P.W.9) then went to their village abadi and informed the Chowkidar who came to the spot. After deputing the Chowkidar to guard the dead bodies, Satbir proceeded to the Police Station to lodge a report. On the way he met ASI Dalip Singh (P.W. 24) at the bus stand and reported the incident. Dalip Singh recorded his statement (Ext. PX) and, after forwarding the same to the Police Station for registering a case, took up investigation. Dalip Singh went to the place of occurrence accompanied by Satbir and prepared inquest reports in respect of the three dead bodies which were lying there. He then sent the dead bodies for post mortem examination. From the spot he seized some blood stained earth and chillies and made them into separate sealed parcels. 4. The autopsy on the dead body of Suraj Bhan was performed by Dr. R.P. Sharma (P.W.3) who found seven injuries on his person, out of which three were incised wounds and other four lacerated. Dr. R.A. Mittal (P.W. 4) performed autopsy on the body of Bir Singh and found eight lacerated wounds, besides some contusions and abrasions.

Since the appellant was reluctant to leave Giddar Pindi, he locked the gate of the hospital so that the deceased could not take over charge.

Five co-accused were convicted under section 302 read with section 148 while the appellant was convicted under section 302 of The Indian-Panel Code and was sentenced to suffer life imprisonment. It must be stated at the outset that there are concurrent findings of facts recorded by both the courts below whereby it is found that the appellant was instrumental in giving pistol shot injury on the forehead of the deceased, Balwant Singh on that fateful night. For arriving at the said finding reliance was placed by both the courts on the eye-witness account of prosecution witness no. 4, Dalel Singh, brother of the deceased who is said to be present with the deceased in the bara. Reliance is also placed on the evidence of PW-S,Mansa Ram, father of the deceased who was also sleeping nearby on his cot. In order to appreciate the grievance voiced on behalf of the appellant by his learned counsel, it is necessary to note a few background facts. Balwant Singh, deceased was the younger brother of Dalel Singh PW- They had another brother Baldev Singh, who was youngest of them all. All three of them were married and used to live separately. Their father, Mansa Ram, PW-5 used to reside with Baldev Singh, the youngest son. Near the house of Dalel Singh PW-4, there was a vacant site of land which stood in the name of Mansa Ram, father of Dalel Singh PW- This bara was the bone of contention between the complainant side and the side of the accused. Mansa Ram PW-5 claimed ownership and possession of this bara while one Surta Ram, son of Chhaju Ram claimed ownership of the bara in himself. Appellant, Ram Kumar, is the son of Surta Ram. It is the case of the prosecution that a litigation regarding this bara was pending in court since years and the trial court had decided the same in favour of Mansa Ram. Against that decision an appeal was pending in the High Court on behalf of Surta Ram, father of appellant Ram Kumar. It is the further case of the prosecution that pending this appeal, Ram Kumar on behalf of his father was insisting the complainant's side to vacate the bara. That two days prior to the incident, i.e. on 82 the appellant Ram Kumar and accused Shamsher Singh came to the bara, abused the complainant and asked them to vacate the bara. They again came on 82, previous day of the incident, abused them and asked them to vacate the bara. Because of these threats, the complainant-side convened a Panchayat meeting on the day of the incident, i.e. 82 and although the accused were summoned they did not turn up in the Panchayat. The Panchayat dispersed after waiting for two hours and then followed the fateful incident on the night of that very day. As deposed to by complainant PW-4, before the trial court at about 30 to 10 PM, the complainant, deceased Balwant Singh and also their father, Mansa Ram were lying on their respective cots in front side of the bara. Mansa Ram was on his cot in the door of the bara. That at that time, a fiat car of cream colour arrived there and the driver of the car brought it near the cots. Six persons alighted from the car. They included, amongst others, the appellant Ram Kumar and co-accused Shamsher Singh and started abusing them. They wanted to know why they had not vacated the bara although they had insisted for two days. When Balwant Singh was in the process of getting up, the accused, except Ram Kumar challenged that a lesson should be taught to the complainant for not vacating the bara. At that juncture the appellant, Ram Kumar fired a shot from his pistol which hit Balwant Singh. Balwant Singh fell down on the ground. The complainant and his father, Mansa Ram raised an alarm. By that time, the accused persons bolted away in the said car. In connection with this incident, a police complaint was lodged. The deceased was, in the meantime, removed to the Hospital at Nilokheri in injured condition. But within half an hour, he expired in the hospital.

Pratibha (since deceased) was the daughter of Kamal Goyal (PW 2) a resident of Sangrur. She was married to Ravi Kumar (A-3) on February 19, It was an arranged marriage. Kamal Goyal comes from a middle class family and is in service with limited source of income. At the proposal stage Kamal Goyal alleged to have made it clear that having regard to his means the marriage would be a simple one. He claimed to have spent on marriage of pratibha an amount of rs. 70,000/-. ravi Kumar (A-3) and Narinder Kumar (A-4) who has been acquitted are the sons of Baldev Krishan (A-1). Sarla Devi (S-2) is the wife of A- They are the residents of Jullundur city, owning a ground floor and one stormy house. On the ground floor they run business in electric goods under the name of B.K. Electrical Industry; whereas the first floor is used for their residence. It is a joint Hindu family. Baldev Krishan being a businessman was then having comparatively a better financial position. 2. Smt. pratibha after her marriage came to Jullundur and resided with her husband and in laws. In the last week of February, 1981, Kamal Goyal came to Jullundur and took away Smt. Pratibha to Sangrur. Pratibha told her father that her in-laws were of a very greedy nature and were criticising her on dowry issue. On the following day on reaching Sangrur A-3 sent a telephonic message to Kamal Goyal that his mother was taken ill and Pratibha would return within a short period. Accordingly, she was brought back to Jullundur. After about two or three months. Pratibha again came to Sangrur and told her father that all the accused persons were taunting her for having brought nothing in dowry and that the clothes brought by her in dowry were mere rags and even other articles were not given worth to their use. It is alleged that Pratibha used to explain to her in-laws that her father came from an ordinary family and whatever he could give in dowry had been given and there was no point in criticising her parents. It is common premise that Rekha Rani (PW 1) who happened to be her aunt was residing at Jullundur and as and when Pratibha met her she used to convey as to how she was illtreated by the accused. Upon hearing the distressing remarks made by the accused, the father used to advise Pratibha not to take the remarks of her in-laws seriously and things would be settled down after passage of time. Pratibha used to tell her parents that her husband (A-3) and mother-in-law (A-2) used to tease her on her squint. It may be stated that Pratibha was blessed with a son on December 24, 1981, at her parents' house and this event was celebrated by her father by inviting members of her i-laws family and spent about rs. 7,000/- on customary gifts (Shushak). It is then alleged by the prosecution that on June 2, 1981 which was a Nirjala Ekadasi day, Smt. Rekha Rani (PW 1) and her husband Vijay Kumar (PW 5) went to the house of the accused for giving her presents. Rekha Rani wished Pratibha but, however, she was found to be depressed. At that time A-2 told Rekha Rani that she should have searched a boy having a squint as a better match for Pratibha having a status commensurate with a girl. A-2 also taunted saying that they accepted the proposal as Kamal Goyal was a gentleman but he had given rages in dowry. A-2 also alleged to have remarked that Kamal Goyal was a scoundrel and would learn a lesson when he would marry his other children. He must find out only scoundrels. Rekha Rani thereafter came to an adjoining courtyard where A-3 was sitting with a view to have to talk to him and convey the remarks may by A- Sarla Devi (A-2) thereafter followed her whereupon A-3 told his mother to keep quiet and should not talk nonsense. A-2 thereupon stated that she would set right Pratibha as God has given her a lot of money. A-2 also then passed remarks saying that some other proposals had come for. A-3 offering dowry of two lakhs. After hearing these remarks of A-2 Rekha Rani returned to her room. 3. It is then alleged by the prosecution that on June 5, 1982 Kamal Goyal came to Jullundur for taking Smt. Pratibha to Amritsar where his mother-in-law was ailing. He also intimated to A-1 that he would be taking Smt. Pratibha on June 6, 1992 to Sangrur as the marriage of his brother (Kamal Goyal's brother) was to take place on June 20, 1982 at Delhi. Accordingly on 5th June, 1992 Kamal Goyal came to the house of Accused whereupon A-1 and A-3 told him that Pratibha would accompany him. Kamal Goyal then went to the house of Rekha Rani who told him that Pratibha was not happy as the members of her in-laws family were taunting her on various grounds including a squint in the eye. At about 00 p.m. Kamal Goyal went to the house of A-1 and he was told by A-1 and A-3 that Pratibha would not accompany him. Kamal Goyal wanted to sort out the differences and, therefore, he along with A-1 and A-3 went to the drawing room on upstairs. A-2 and Pratibha also came there and it was found that the latter was very much disturbed. Pratibha told her father that all the accused were ill- treating her and calling her and him as bastards. Kamal Goyal according to the prosecution told the accused that he belonged to a cultured family and requested not to abuse. Sarla (A-2) then told him that because of this matrimonial relation and of meagre gifts of a poor quality their status in the society was lowered down. It is alleged by the prosecution that A-2 complained to Kamal Goyal that Pratibha had no desire to work in the house and was a burden to the family. Accused persons then told Kamal Goyal that Pratibha would not accompany him. 4. Despite the protest Kamal Goyal requested the accused to send Pratibha to Sangrur with him at about 00 p.m. on the following day. Kamal Goyal accordingly went to the house of the accused on June 6, Pratibha was getting ready to accompany him but after some time she came with tears in her eyes and told him that she would not accompany him. Kamal Goyal found her very much frightened and perplexed and wanted to know from her the reasons therefor but she refused to say anything at that time. Kamal Goyal then asked Baldev Krishan (A-1) as to what was happening in the house and who had threatened Pratibha whereupon he told him not to worry and he would take every precaution and responsibility of her safe stay in the house. A-2 then told Kamal Goyal that Pratibha would come directly to Delhi on June 18, 1982 or she would be sent to Sangrur either on 21th or 13th June, 1982. With great disappointment Kamal Goyal returned to Sangrur and since he was worried about Pratibha's well being, wrote a letter exhibit PB to Vijay Kumar (PW 5) and sent another to A-1 on June 7, Smt. Janak, the mother of Pratibha also wrote a few lines on exhibit PB to Smt. Rekha Rani. It is alleged by the prosecution that relations between Pratibha and members of her in-laws family instead of improving worsened and ultimately on June 8, 1992, she died of burn injuries in her matrimonial house. 5. Coming to the eventful afternoon of June 8, 1982 at about 30 p.m. Raj Kumar (PW 4) happened to pass in front of the shop of A-1 and saw many persons gathered there. People were taking that accused persons had burnt their daughter-in-law on account of their greed for dowry. He noticed that the accused persons were very much perturbed. He then went to the house of Rekha Rani to inform her about the incident. Rekha Rani and Vijay Kumar reached the house of accused immediately. Pratibha had sustained burn injuries between 00 and 00 p.m. on 8th June, Dr. R. N. Batra (DW 1) who had come to the house of A-1 at about 00 p.m. was asked to inform Kamal Goyal on telephone about the death of Pratibha. Kamal Goyal on receipt of a telephone call from Dr. R. N. Batra from the house of A-1 was shocked to hear about his daughter's death. Kamal Goyal wanted to talk to A-1 personally but doctor told him that he would not be able to speak on telephone due to shock. Kamal Goyal and his wife left Sangrur for Jullundur and reached at the house of A-1 during mid night. 6. In the meantime A-1 asked Chanan Ram (DW 4) to go and lodge a report at the police station. However, at about 30 p.m. he met ASI Hardip Singh near the Laxmi Cinema and told him about the incident. His statement exhibit PH was recorded and the crime came to be registered as \"death due to accidental burns. \" ASI Hardip Singh then reached the place of occurrence and started the investigation. An inquest exhibitP was held on the dead body of Pratibha. He also prepared the Panchnama of place of occurrence.
