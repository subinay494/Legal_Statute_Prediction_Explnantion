Upon this Atma Ram lodged First Information Report at Police Station Srimadhopur stating therein that his daughter Shanti @ Gokul was married to Jeevan Ram, son of Jagdish Balai (Jaggu Ram), resident of Nathusar about eighteen months ago; that he gave dowry according to his capacity; that immediately after the marriage, Jaggu Ram, his son Jeevan Ram and wife Nathi started harassing Shanti in connection with dowry; that after three days of marriage they left Radio, Press etc. and demanded watch and jewellery; that they with a view to save his daughter from harassment, he gave silver ornaments viz. Paizeb (anklet), Tagadi, Locket and Ear-rings apart from cash of rs. 10,000/- to her in-laws, but this did not satisfy them and after three months, they again started harassing her and left her at village Abhawas, where she stayed at his house for 8 months; that a meeting was held at village Abhawas which was attended by 22-25 people including Jaggu Ram (the respondent herein), Rameshwar Mali, Chhitar Kheteek and Bhagega Balai of village Nathusar. In that meeting Jaggu Ram assured that he will keep Gokul without creating any problem; that thereafter he went to Nathusar six to seven times to bring her daughter to Abhawas but her husband and in-laws did not send her and demanded colour television. They also threatened that if additional dowry is not brought, then his daughter will be finished. He told the villagers about the demand made by Jaggu Ram and his family and the threat given by them. Upon this, the villagers sent a message to Jaggu Ram that it was not proper. Jaggu Ram and his family members got annoyed by this development and they killed his daughter by burning with kerosene and cremated her body at 00 a.m. on Thereupon, the police registered Criminal Case no.48/93 under Sections 498A, 304-B and 201 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860.", "statute": ["s3", "s2"]}, "2012.INSC.535.txt": {"doc_url": "http://www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/2012/535/.html", "explanation": {"Chandran (PW.2) found the room full of smoke and Jayalakshmi lying dead on the bed, with burn injuries.": ["s3"], "the post-mortem and opined that the deceased had died of smothering and burn injuries.": ["s2"]}, "fact": " vs STATE TR.INSP.OF POLICE [2012] INSC 535 (19 September 2012) **Judgement** REPORTABLE IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION CRIMINAL APPEAL NO.  1517 OF 2008 Pudhu Raja & Anr.

This appeal has been preferred against the final judgment and order dated 2008, passed by the High Court of Judicature at Madras in Criminal Appeal no.337 of 2005, by way of which, the High Court has allowed the State appeal against the judgment and order dated 2004 in Sessions Case no.618 of 2003 passed by the Additional District & Sessions Judge, (Fast Track Court no.1), Chengalpet, Kachipuram District, by which, the Trial Court had acquitted the appellants of the charges under Sections 302 r/w 34, 304(b) and 201 of the Indian Indian Penal Code, 1860, 1860, 1860 (hereinafter referred to as the Indian Penal Code, 1860).  2.  The facts and circumstances giving rise to this appeal as per prosecution are as follows: A.  Padhu Raja (A-1), son of Smt.  Angammal (A-2), got married to one Jayalakshmi (deceased), on 1998 at Gudalur.  At the time of marriage the appellant (A-1) demanded 50 Sovereigns of jewels and rs.2 lacs in cash, however the parents of the deceased gave 35 sovereigns of jewels and cash to the tune of rs.50,000/-.  Thereafter, there were persistent demand for dowry by the appellants from time to time, particularly on festive occasions.  Those demands were even met.  Appellant (A-1) made a demand for a motor bike which was also met by the parents of the deceased in the presence of several villagers, including the village Head, namely Bose, (PW.6).  However, even after this, the demands continued.  In July 2000, Jayalakshmi came to her parents house and told them that a demand had been made by the husband for 15 sovereigns of jewels, without fulfilling which, she must not return.  B.  A Panchayat was convened and thereupon, the appellant (A-1), and Jayalakshmi (deceased), started living separately in a house belonging to Chandran (PW.2), at 9, C.N.  Krishna Street, Bharathi Nagar, Perianatham.  Karthikeyan (PW.4) and his wife Mrs.  Malliga (PW.3) were living in close proximity to the appellants.  Jayalakshmi had told Mrs.  Malliga (PW.3) on certain occasions, that the appellants had been torturing her.  C.  On 2001, at about 1 A.M.  , Mrs.  Malliga (PW.3), noticed smoke rising up from the ground floor where the appellants and deceased were living.  She immediately informed Karthikeyan (PW.4) and then also came out to ascertain the cause for the smoke alongwith her husband, Karthikeyan (PW.4).  Chandran (PW.2) and his wife also came out of their house.  Chandran (PW.2) found the appellants standing outside the gate.  On being asked by Chandran (PW.2) about the key of the house, as the same was locked from the outside, the appellant (A- 1), replied that the second appellant had thrown away the key.  Chandran (PW.2) went upstairs, brought a duplicate key and opened the door of their house.  Chandran (PW.2) found the room full of smoke and Jayalakshmi lying dead on the bed, with burn injuries.  The Fire Brigade was informed.  Mr.  Mahalingam, Station Officer, Fire Department Chengalpet, (PW.8) arrived at the spot with his personnel, at 45 A.M.  and extinguished the fire.  Mr.  Ezhamparuthi (PW.1), a close relative of the deceased came to the spot upon being informed, and thereafter went to the Police Station at 30 A.M.  on 2001 and made a complaint to Mr.  Kotteswaran (PW.12), on the basis of which, a case in Crime no.157 of 2001 was registered.  The said FIR was handed over to Mr.  Durairaj (PW.13), the Investigating Officer who then took up the investigation.  D.  Durairaj (PW.13) recovered the dead body of Jayalakshmi (deceased), after taking photographs of the place of occurrence and also of the dead body of the deceased, through the photographer Balaji (PW.11).  Durairaj (PW.13) also recovered all material objects and prepared the mahazar.  E.  As Jayalakshmi had died within 2-1/2 years of her marriage, the matter was reported to the Sub-Collector, Ms.  Pila Rajesh, IAS (PW.10) who came to the spot and conducted inquest on the dead body in the presence of witnesses and a panchnama was prepared.  Ms.  Pila Rajesh (PW.10) also recorded the statements of the witnesses after which, the dead body was sent for post-mortem.  F.  Prof.  Muguesan (PW.9), who is attached to the Govt.

SANTOSH HEGDE,J.  Respondent herein was convicted by the Sessions Judge, Dharmapuri Division at Krishnagiri for an offence punishable under section 302 Indian Penal Code, 1860 and was awarded the extreme penalty of death.  In a reference made by the learned Sessions Judge for confirmation of the said sentence and also in an appeal filed by the respondent against the said conviction and sentence, the High Court of Judicature at Madras by the impugned judgment while dismissing the reference for confirmation of the sentence, allowed the appeal, setting aside the judgment of the learned Sessions Judge.  The State of Tamil Nadu is in appeal against the said common judgment of the High Court.  The allegation against the respondent in this case is that he committed the murder of one D.  Rathinam who was the Incharge Sub-Post Master of K.R.P.  Dam Post Office on 1984 with a view to wreak vengeance against him for having accused him of stealing rs.10 and also with a view to rob the Post Office.  It is the case of the prosecution that at the relevant time the respondent was working temporarily as an extra departmental mail carrier in place of his father who was on leave.  The prosecution alleged that since the Post Office was found locked on a working day namely on 1984, PW-4 who was also working in the said Post Office, informed PW-1 who was then the Sub-Divisional Post Inspector about this locking of the Post Office who, in turn, informed PW-6, the Deputy Superintendent of Post Office over the phone as to this unusual incident of finding the Post Office locked on a working day.  On instructions from PW-6, PW-1 made necessary arrangements to safeguard and protect the properties of the said Post Office and on the morning of 1984 said PW-1 went to the Post Office and broke open the lock in the presence of the Village Administrative Officer and other office personnel and on taking an inventory of the said office, they found certain cash, postal stamps, postal orders and cash certificates etc.  valued at rs.55 missing.  They also found Rathinam who was the Incharge of the office on 1984 missing but found his shoes in the Post Office, hence on a suspicion they searched for him during which process they found the body of said Rathinam inside the septic tank situated in the backyard of the said Post Office.  On lodging a complaint in this regard, a case was registered in Taluk Police Station, Krishnagiri being Crime no.142 of 1984 under sections 302 and 380 Indian Penal Code, 1860.  PW-12 who took up the investigation, came to the spot on 1984 and inspected the scene of occurrence and drew up the inquest Panchnama exhibit P- He made inquiries during the said inquest proceedings and recorded the statements of PWs.1, 3, 6 and one Rajan.  He made arrangement to send the dead body for autopsy.  As per the medical report it was found that the deceased died due to injuries suffered by him on his head also due to asphyxia.  It is the further case of the prosecution that on 1984 at about 5 a.m.  PW-2 arrested the respondent near the river-bed adjacent to Kaveripattinam Travellers' bungalow and on a disclosure statement made by the accused in the presence of PW-8, he recovered MO-28, a blood stained shirt belonging to respondent kept concealed in the river-bed.  He also recovered a bunch of keys belonging to the Post Office at the instance of the respondent, kept in a post-box kept in front of a textile shop.  On a further statement made by the respondent the I.O.  recovered MO-13 a yellow bag from a cycle shop of one Pattu (not examined) in which he found various properties like the inland letters, postcards, postal stamps, revenue stamps etc.  allegedly stolen by the respondent.  On a further statement made by the respondent he also recovered certain sums of money kept concealed under a hill as also a blood stained towel kept concealed under a tree in the backyard of the Post Office.  From the statement of PW-3, the I.O.  found out that on 1984 in the afternoon the respondent was seen coming out of the Post Office locking the same, carrying a yellow bag like MO-13 and on an inquiry by PW-3 she was told by respondent that he was locking the office since it was a holiday for the Post Office.  From the evidence of PW-11 he came to know that the respondent had kept the yellow bag MO-13 in the shop of Pattu of which PW-11 was the owner of the building.  Based on this a chargesheet was filed before the Judicial Second Class Magistrate, Krishnagiri against the respondent for offences under Sections 302, 201 and 381 Indian Penal Code, 1860 and on committal and after trial the learned Sessions Judge found the respondent guilty of all the 3 offences but punished him only for the offence under Section 302 and imposed the sentence of extreme penalty of death which as stated above was not confirmed by the High Court and the appellant's appeal against his conviction was also allowed.  In the absence of any direct evidence the prosecution case depended on various circumstances which were accepted by the trial court but were held not proved by the High Court.  The High Court after noticing the law in regard to basing a conviction on circumstantial evidence enumerated the various circumstances placed by the prosecution in this case.  They are : \" 1.  The accused being found in the company of the deceased at 12 noon on 84 within the office premises; 2.  The accused emerging out of the said Post Office where he was working, carrying in his hand M.O.13 yellow bag; 3.  The so called explanation given by the accused to P.W.3 that holiday had been declared to the Post Office after lunch recess, when P.W.3 questioned him as to when the Post Office was to commence business after lunch recess; 4.  His absconding from the Office on and from 1984; 5.  His arrest on Consequent confession he was stated to have made and recovery of certain material objects pursuant to such confession, viz.  , M.O.12 series, M.O.13 bag containing M.Os.14 to 25, M.O.26 series, M.Os.27 and 28; 6.  M.O.27 towel recovery at the instance of the accused pursuant to Sec.27 of the Evidence Act confession- statement, containing human blood as disclosed by Serologist report, Exhibit P.  7.  The motive aspect of the case of the prosection getting reflected by the testimony of P.W.4 to whom the deceased appeared to have told either on 14th or 15th March 1984 about the commission theft of rs.10/- by the accused from the shirt pocket and on hearing the same, P.W.4 reprimanded him for his abominable conduct and requested the deceased to pardon the accused for such an act of his and the deceased also complied with such a request.  \" The very same circumstances were considered by the trial court also, which held that these circumstances were proved and were sufficient to bring home the guilt of the accused.  While the High Court on a re-appreciation of the evidence led by the prosecution to prove the abovesaid circumstances, came to the conclusion that the prosecution evidence led in support of these circumstances cannot be said to have been proved beyond all reasonable doubt.  It also came to the conclusion that some of the circumstances cannot be treated as circumstances indicating the guilt of the accused.  They are the circumstances like the presence of the accused in the Post Office and he being found in the company of the deceased on According to the High Court, it is the prosecution's own case that the respondent accused was an employee of the said post office, though a temporary one, at the relevant time, therefore, these circumstances do not implicate the respondent.  In regard to the other circumstances, the High Court came to the conclusion that the witnesses who have spoken about the same, are either chance witnesses and there being contradictions in their evidence, it is not safe to place reliance on the same.  We have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the records.  The appeal before us arises out of a reversing judgment of the High Court which having considered the material adduced by the prosecution, took a view contrary to the one taken by the trial court, therefore, in the normal course unless we are satisfied that the said finding of the High Court is either arbitrary or perverse, this Court would not interfere with the said finding.  In this process, we find most of the reasoning of the High Court while rejecting the evidence of the prosecution witnesses cannot be said to be either perverse or the one that cannot be arrived at by any prudent person.  However, we must notice that so far as the rejection of the evidence of PW-3 by the High Court is concerned, we do not think the reason given by the High Court is proper.  The High Court came to the conclusion that since PW-3 did not complain to anybody else about the fishy conduct of the accused immediately after he was seen coming out of the Post Office and locking the same, in our opinion, cannot be the sole reason to reject her evidence on the facts of this case.  Be that as it may, there is yet another very good reason to discard the evidence of PW- PW-12, the I.O.  , in his evidence has stated that he recorded the statement of this witness on 1984 during the inquest proceedings but this witness in her evidence before the court has stated that her evidence was recorded a day after the inquest proceedings were conducted.  This is a material contradiction in regard to which the prosecution has not taken any step to clarify this part of her evidence when PW-3 was in the witness box by way of re-examination, therefore, if PW-3's evidence is to be accepted then the inquest proceedings must have taken place on 1984 itself but that is not the case of the prosecution.  Since the time and date of the incident are very material facts in this case, the contradiction in the evidence of PW-3 in this regard cannot be brushed aside.  That apart, it has come in evidence that the job of the accused was to carry the mail bag daily from the K.R.P.  Dam Post Office to Sundekuppam Post Office and it is not the case of the prosecution that this job was entrusted to anybody else on In this context, if we examine the evidence of PW-8, the Post Master of Sundekuppam, he states in his evidence that even on 1984 the post bag was taken from K.R.P.  Dam Post Office to Sundekuppam.  No explanation whatsoever is rendered by the prosecution as to how this was possible if the respondent-accused was absconding on that day, and when the murder was detected on that day.  These suspicions surrounding circumstances pleaded by the prosecution remain unexplained.  That apart, we also notice some other materials from the prosecution case which compounds our suspicion in regard to the prosecution case.  It is the case of the prosecution that on 1984 after the arrest of the accused, he led them to a tree just behind the Post Office building whereunder a blood- stained towel was recovered.  The prosecution had earlier alleged that the body of the deceased was found in a septic tank behind the Post Office on The tree under which blood stained towel was recovered is also behind the Post Office, therefore, the septic tank and the tree must be close to each other.  If that be so, how the investigating agency missed noticing the blood- stained towel under the tree on the day of inquest is not explained by the prosecution.  From the evidence in this regard led by the prosecution, there is nothing to show that this blood- stained towel was concealed in such a manner that the I.O.  could not have noticed it on 1984 itself.  There is also one other circumstance to be taken note of.  It is the case of the prosecution that the respondent-accused made a disclosure statement at the time when he was arrested at Kaveripattinam, and as per the statement, a blood-stained shirt was recovered.  According to the prosecution, this is the same shirt which was worn by the accused when he committed the murder but there is no material to show that he had changed this shirt when he came out of the Post Office.  Therefore, if really this blood- stained shirt is the one that was worn by the accused at the time of the murder then PW-3 would not have failed to notice the blood- stains on his shirt when she saw him and also spoke to him on This circumstance also, in our opinion, goes against the prosecution.", "statute": ["s3", "s2"]}, "1997.INSC.784.txt": {"doc_url": "http://www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/1997/784/.html", "explanation": {"A-2, A-4 and A-13 thereafter caught hold of the hands and feet of Sukhdarshan whereupon A-1 assaulted him with Banka and severed his head and kept it in a piece of cloth.": ["s2"], "The miscreants then took out the diesel from the drum and sprinkled it on the Chappar (roof) and also poured it into the room through a hole where Surendra was hiding and then lit the fire to chappar and asked Surendra to come out otherwise all his family members would be done to death.": ["s2"]}, "fact": " ##  SHRI RAM & SHIV RAM & ANR V. STATE OF U.P. & ORS [1997] INSC 784 (21 October 1997)  The motive of the present crime was sought to be traced by the prosecution from the murder of Chandrika Passi, who was a brother of A-1 and resident of village Bajarakha.  This murder took place two and a half months prior to the present occurrence that took place on 23.6.1990.  The murder of Chandrika was alleged to be brutal one as his head was severed.  The family members of Chandrika were suspecting that Sheo Pal and Ram Gulam, the relatives of Sukhdarshan had committed the said murder and, therefore, the criminal case against both of them for an offence of murder is stated to be pending. The accused laboured under a belief that Sheo Pal, Ram Gulam and his relatives were responsible for the murder of Chandrika and it was this belief which gave cause to nurture enmity against the family members of Bhuwaneshwari, Sheo Pal and Ram Gulam.  The second reason for enmity sought to be alleged by the prosecution was that Prem Giri (A-10) (since deceased) who was residing in an adjacent house to Bhuwaneshwari, had an axe to grind against the family of latter as a civil dispute in regard to the property belonging to \"Thakurji Trust\" was pending between them.  Bhuwaneshwari obtained the decree against Prem Giri in the trial Court but we are told that the appeal filed by Prem Giri is pending in the higher court.  The occurrence in question took place on 23.6.90 at about 5.00 p.m.,Mahendra Kumar (P.W.1) lodged the FIR at about 9.05 p.m. at Mitauli Police Station situated at a distance of 15 km. from the place of incident.  In his complaint Mahendra Kumar (P.W.1) had disclosed all the 24 named accused along with 8 to 10 unidentified persons who had come to the house of Bhuwaneshwari.  He then stated that at that time he and Surendra (deceased) were sitting near the couldron and his father Sukhdarshan (deceased) was sitting near the Kolhoo.  All the accused person, armed with deadly weapons, reached near the Kolhoo.  A-1, A-2, A-4 and A-13 were armed with Bankas, A-10 was carrying a DBBL licensed gun, A-3 and A-16 were armed with SBBL guns, A-20 was carrying country made SBBL gun and the remaining accused were armed with country made pistols and guns.  The accused persons when reached near the Kolhoo, started abusing Sukhdarshan and Bhuwaneshwari (both since deceased) and were also giving bad words on other members of their family.  Then all the accused demanded show how both could remain alive.  Saying so all the accused persons chased Sukhdarshan who out of fear entered into the house of Shambhudayal and raised an alarm.  Kamlesh (since deceased)s/o Shambhudayal and Shakuntala after allowing Sukhdarshan inside the housetried to shut the door bu the accused inserted the barrel of the gun through the door and fired which hit Kamlesh who fell down.  The miscreants then opened the door and after entering into the house fired at Sukhdarshan, who fell down in the courtyard.  A-2, A-4 and A-13 thereafter caught hold of the hands and feet of Sukhdarshan whereupon A-1 assaulted him with Banka and severed his head and kept it in a piece of cloth.  The assailants then surrounded the house of Mahendra Kumar (P.W.1) the complainant, opened the door, demolished the walls and entered into his house.  Family members of Mahendra Kumar (P.W.1), namely, Goura the grand mother of Surendra, and his wife Manorama, were inside the house, they requested them not to assault any of the family members.  Surendra (since deceased) had a licensed gun.  He immediately closed and bolted the door of his room from inside.  Since the door could not be opened, A-1 told his associates to sprinkle the diesel on the house and set it on fire.  The miscreants then took out the diesel from the drum and sprinkled it on the Chappar (roof) and also poured it into the room through a hole where Surendra was hiding and then lit the fire to chappar and asked Surendra to come out otherwise all his family members would be done to death.  The miscreants then opened the door and after entering into the house fired at Sukhdarshan, who fell down in the courtyard.

The prosecution, in order to, bring home the guilt of the appellant examined eight witnesses, of whom Pritam Kaur (PW 3) and Sohan Singh (PW 4) are the eye witnesses to the occurrence.  SI Balkar Singh (PW 8) is the Investigating Officer.  Dr Paramjit Singh (PW 5) is the medical officer who conducted the post mortem examination on the dead bodies of Swarn Singh and Balwant Singh.  The appellant in his defence examined Joginder Singh (DW 1) and Gian Singh (DW 2).  7.  The Learned judge of Designated Court on appreciation of oral and documentary evidence on record vide his impugned judgment and order convicted the appellant under Section 302/34 and 201 of the Indian Indian Penal Code, 1860, 1860 and on first count, sentenced him to suffer imprisonment for life and a fine of rs.  500/-; in default of payment of fine, further RI for two months.  On second count, RI for seven years and fine of rs.  200/-; in default of payment of fine, further RI for one month.  The Designated Court also found the appellant guilty under Section 3 of TADA and sentenced him to suffer RI for five years and to pay a fine of rs.  200/-; in default of payment of fine further RI for two months.  The substantive sentences were ordered to run concurrently.  It is this judgment and order which is the subject matter of challenge in this appeal.  8.  At the outset, it may be stated that the Learned Counsel for the appellant did not and could not dispute the fact that Swarn Singh and Balwant Singh died homicidal deaths.  The evidence of Dr.  Paramjit Singh (PW 5) who held the autopsy on the two dead bodies noted as many as four lacerated wounds on the dead body of Swaran Singh and tow lacerated wounds on the dead body of Balwant Singh.  He further stated that these injuries were ante mortem and caused due to fire arm.  They were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause the death of both the victims.  We, therefore, unhesitatingly hold that Swaran Singh and Balwant Singh died homicidal deaths in an incident which took place in the night of 3rd April, 9.  Coming to the complicity of the appellant (accused) and co-accused (absconding), the prosecution case mainly rested on the evidence of Pritam Kaur (PW 3) and Sohan Singh, (PW 4).  Mr.  R.C.  Verma, the Learned Counsel appearing in support of this appeal urged that both these eye witnesses did not state in their evidence that the appellant was a party to the preparation of assault or infact present and participated in the firing.  He urged that the appellant is convicted with the aid of Section 34 Indian Penal Code, 1860 for the substantive offence punishable under Section 302 Indian Penal Code, 1860, however, the evidence on record does not justify the conviction.  It is the case of the prosecution that tow unidentified assailants came from the side of the house of the accused by scaling the compound wall and thereafter opened the fire on Swarn Singh and Balwant Singh One of the unidentified assailants gave a call to the appellant who than came to the courtyard of the deceased.  But at the time, the firing was stopped and three persons were already killed.  In the facts and circumstances of the case, therefore, Mr.  Verma, urged that the accused cannot be convicted with the aid of Section 34 Indian Penal Code, 1860 for the substantive offence punishable under Section 302 Indian Penal Code, 1860.  10.  Mr.  Yadav, the Learned Counsel appearing for the State of Punjab supported the impugned judgment.  11.  As stated earlier, the appellant has been convicted with the aid of Section 34 Indian Penal Code, 1860 and, therefore, it is necessary to find out as to whether the appellant shared a common intention to commit the murder of either Swarn Singh of Balwant Singh.  12.  Pritam Kaur (PW 3) who is the widow of Swarn Singh (since deceased) in her evidence has stated that at about 00 p.m.  on 3rd April, 1991, when she, Swaran Singh and Balvinder Singh were sitting in their room, the unidentified assailants came in their courtyard by scaling the compound was and called her husband Swaran Singh and son Balwant Singh, who came out of the room.  These two assailants suddenly fired at her husband and son as a result of which they died on the spot.  One the assailant, namely, Narvail Singh also died in her courtyard.  Balvinder Singh (absconding accused) then called the appellant and told him that his companion was shot dead and he was to be carried on gharuka of Balwant Singh.  The appellant then came to her courtyard and threatened her and Sohan Singh (PW 4) not to raise any alarm and keep quiet otherwise they would be killed.  The appellant and absconding co-accused carried the dead body of Narvail Singh on Gharuka belonging to her son.  She further stated that the appellant was not on talking terms with them as he suspected that Sohan Singh (PW 4) had given his share in the lands to Swarn Singh and Balwant Singh (since deceased).  13.  Sohan Singh (PW 4) who is another eye witness to the occurrence stated that on 3rd April, 1991, at about 00 p.m.  , tow assailants i.e.  Narvail Singh (since deceased) and Balvinder Singh (the absconding accused) came into the courtyard and asked Swarn Singh and his son Balwant Singh to come out of the house.  Suddenly, the deceased Narvail Singh and absconding accused fired at Swarn Singh and Balwant Singh as a result thereof they died on the spot.  He further stated that Balvinder Singh Butto called the appellant and told him that his companion was killed and he was to be carried on a gharuka.  The appellant then came to his courtyard and thereafter they carried the dead body of Narvail Singh on gharuka.  The appellant then warned them not to disclose the incident to anybody otherwise they would meet the same fate.  14.  This is the only direct evidence led by the prosecution to prove the complicity of the appellant in the present crime.  Now, the question that needs to be considered in this appeal is as to whether the above evidence is sufficient to uphold the conviction of the appellant with the aid of Section 34 of the Indian Indian Penal Code, 1860, 1860 for causing two murders? The evidence of Pritam Kaur (PW 3) and Sohan Singh (PW 4) is only to the effect that two accused, namely, Narvail Singh (since deceased) and Balvinder Singh (absconding) came from the house of the appellant into their courtyard by scaling the compound wall and thereafter they opened fire in which Swaran Singh and Balwant Singh were killed.  It is not the case of either of the eye witness that the appellant had participated in the firing at Swaran Singh and Balwant.  The prosecution has led no evidence to show that these two accused and the appellant shared a common intention to commit the murders when they came from the house of the appellant by scaling the compound wall.  Admittedly, the appellant was not present at the time when the incident took place, but positive evidence on the record is that he came in the courtyard of Pritam Kaur (PW 3) when Balvinder Singh, the absconding accused told him (appellant) that his companion had been killed and he was to be carried on gharuka.  The only circumstance that could be said to have been proved by the prosecution against the appellant is that he and Balvinder Singh, the absconding accused head threatened both the eye witnesses not to disclose this incident to anybody otherwise they would be done to death.  This evidence, in our opinion, is not sufficient to hold the appellant guilty for the offence of two murders with the aid of Section 34 of the Indian Panel Code.  There is no evidence on the record to show that the appellant had any serious dispute with Sohan Singh (PW 4) or Swarn Singh (since deceased).  15.  There is also another important circumstance which goes against the prosecution, viz, that both these witnesses have failed to account as to how Narvail Singh, the other co- accused found dead in their courtyard.  It is not the prosecution case that Balvinder Singh, the absconding accused had fired at Narvail Singh and as a result thereof, he died.  No empty was recovered from the place where Narvail Singh was shot dead.  Both these eye witnesses, however, stated that accused persons took away the dead body of Narvail Singh.  They also took away with them their weapons.  The prosecution, in our opinion, had not unfolded the entire true story before the Court.  This ins the serious lacuna in the prosecution case and, in our opinion, in the absence of any satisfactory explanation, as regards the cause of death of Narvail Singh, the possibility of inmates of the house opening a fire on Narvail Singh could not be ruled out.", "statute": ["s3", "s2"]}, "2009.INSC.355.txt": {"doc_url": "http://www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/2009/355/.html", "explanation": {"She was done to death by the appellant": ["s3"], "Maya's death was \"asphyxiat as a result of suffocation\".": ["s3"], "in order to conceal the crime, he projected that she died of vomiting.": ["s2"]}, "fact": " On 18.11.1977 one Zahid Khan (hereinafter referred to as the `deceased') was killed. and one Azhar Beg alias Gobrey, father of appellant Azmatullah was done to death earlier and in that murder case, deceased Zahid Khan was also one of the accused. Zahid Khan was released on bail a few months before the occurrence of 18.11.1977. Ever since the release of Zahid Khan on bail, the accused had an eye on him and wanted to liquidate him. On 18.11.1977 at about 2 p.m. deceased Zahid Khan followed by his father Khadim Khan (now dead), Samiullah Khan and Salam Khan was coming back on foot with a cycle loaded with two bags of maize after completing the process of sowing of wheat in his plot situating within the limits of village Bangh Bhari.

Mubarak S Appellant Versus State of Maharashtra Respondent Dr.  B.S.  Chauhan, J: 1.  This appeal has been preferred against the impugned judgment and order dated 2007, passed by Special Judge of the Designated Court under the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, 1987 (hereinafter referred to as the TADA) for the Bombay Blast, Greater Bombay, in the Bombay Blast Case no.  1/1993, convicting the appellant under Section 5 TADA, and awarding the punishment of 5 years RI, alongwith a fine of rs.25,000/-, and in default of payment of fine, to further undergo RI for 6 months.  2.  Facts and circumstances giving rise to this appeal are that: A.  As the facts of this case and all legal issues involved herein have been elaborately dealt with in the connected appeal i.e.  Criminal Appeal no.  1728 of 2007 [Yakub Abdul Razak Memon vs State of Maharashtra thr.  CBI], it may be pertinent to mention only the relevant facts and charges against the appellant (A-20).  B.  Bombay Blast took place on 1993 in which 257 persons lost their lives and 713 were injured.  In addition thereto there had been loss of property worth several crores.  The Bombay police investigated the matter at initial stage but subsequently it was entrusted to the Central Bureau of Investigation (hereinafter referred to as CBI) and on conclusion of the investigation, a chargesheet was filed against a large number of accused persons.  Out of the accused persons against whom chargesheet was filed, 40 accused could not be put to trial as they have been absconding.  Thus, the Designated Court under TADA framed charges against 138 accused persons.  During the trial, 11 accused died and 2 accused turned hostile.  Further the Designated Court discharged 2 accused during trial and the remaining persons including appellant (A-20) stood convicted.", "statute": ["s3", "s2"]}, "2002.INSC.461.txt": {"doc_url": "http://www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/2002/461/.html", "explanation": {"the investigation of which was taken up by PW-25 and later on the said case closed on 1986 as \"not traceable\".": ["s2"], "this dead body was that of Vadivelu which was disposed of by the appellants to conceal the actual cause of death, after disfiguring his head.": ["s2"]}, "fact": " A Crime no. 37/1985 was registered in the Wallajahbad Police Station in regard to the murder of a lady and her son in which case the deceased Vadivelu in these appeals and husband of the deceased lady, Ekambaram (PW- 8) and one Loganathan were the suspects and the police were on the look out to arrest these three persons. According to the prosecution case, PW-3 and PW-4 who were the Constables of the Wallajahbad Police Station along with another Constable by name Ponnuswamy were entrusted with the responsibility of locating and producing the deceased Vadivelu for the purpose of investigation in the said case. The prosecution alleges that after considerable effort they with the help of Sivaprakasam who was the brother-in-law of the deceased apprehended the said Vadivelu at Chennai and brought him to the Police Station at Wallajahbad on 1985 and produced him before the A-2 who was in-charge of the police station at Wallajabhad. The said A-2 is an appellant before us. It is the case of the prosecution that A-1 who is another appellant before us, was also a Sub-Inspector of Police in the said police station, and was present in the said station at that time. It is also the case of the prosecution that PW-8 Ekambaram who was another suspect in the double murder case, referred to herein above, was already arrested by the said police and was in the lock up of the said station, though his arrest was not officially recorded. The prosecution case further is that during Vadivelu's custody in the Wallajahbad Police Station, A-1 and A-2 assaulted the deceased by using a Ruler which was noticed by PW- The prosecution then also states that Sivaprakasam who had accompanied Vadivelu with PWs 3 and 4 when he was brought from Chennai also noticed the beating of Vadivelu. The prosecution then states that this Sivaprakasam narrated the incident to PW-1 the wife of Vadivelu, as also to his brother PW- According to the evidence of PWs 3, 4 and 8, A-1 and A-2 thereafter took the deceased in a jeep and was produced before PW-25 who was investigating the double murder case, who in his evidence before the Court stated that after questioning the said deceased he asked A-1 and A-2 to release the deceased. The prosecution further states on 1985 that A-1 and A-2 went in a police jeep to the residence of PW-1 at about 5 p.m. and asked her to hand over certain account books maintained by Vadivelu. This was done in the presence of PW- It is also stated that PW-5, while coming out that evening with the police towards the jeep, saw his father sitting in the jeep, who was then driven away in the jeep by accused A-1 and A- The further case of the prosecution is that in the early morning at about 2 a.m. on 1985 A-1 again went to the residence of PW-1 and asked for a photograph of Vadivelu. During that visit, it is stated that A-1 told PW-1 that her husband has escaped from there, when he was permitted to sleep in the Verandah of the police station. This visit of the accused was also noticed by PW-14 who is a retired School Master and the landlord of PW-1 as also PW-1's son PW- It is the case of the prosecution thereafter, that since Vadivelu did not come back to the house and when Sivaprakasam went to the police station and enquired about the whereabouts of Vadivelu, he was told that he had escaped from custody. A doubt arose in the mind of said Sivaprakasam as to the safety of Vadivelu and, hence, he discussed the matter with his brother PW-6 and also PW-1, and suspected that it is possible that Vadivelu must have been done away with by the concerned police. Therefore, after deliberation, they filed a writ of habeas corpus before the High Court in Chennai, wherein the High Court called upon the respondent-police which included the appellants herein to file their return. It is the case of the prosecution that in the return filed by the respondents in the said habeas corpus writ petition they took the stand that Vadivelu had escaped from the police custody and was absconding. Since after repeated opportunity the deceased was not traced by the police inspite of the directions issued to them by the Court, the High Court by its order dated 1988 directed the Director General of Police, Madras to issue instructions to concerned C.B.C.I.D. to register a case on the missing of Vadivelu from The said order also noticed that admittedly the said Vadivelu was taken into custody by the police and, therefore, the above direction was given to the Director General of Police. It is consequent to this direction issued by the High Court, that PW-26 registered a crime no.6/89 and initiated the investigation into the missing case of Vadivelu and PW-30 thereafter registered a case under Section 302 Indian Penal Code, 1860 after seeking permission from the superior officer, and filed a charge-sheet against the above said accused persons on At this stage, it is necessary to note that from the prosecution case, it is to be seen that on the morning of 1985 a dead body with a crushed head was found within the jurisdiction of Enathur which was noticed by PW-16 Panneerselvam who was then working as a Village Administrative Officer of Enathur, who lodged a complaint in regard to the same which was registered as Crime no.141/85 for an offence under Section 304A Indian Penal Code, 1860, the investigation of which was taken up by PW-25 and later on the said case closed on 1986 as \"not traceable\".

All the accused-appellants stood convicted by the Sessions Judge, Kollam by its judgment dated 2002 for various offences punishable under Sections 120B, 302, 307, 326, 328 and 201 read with Section 34 of the Indian Indian Penal Code, 1860, 1860 (Indian Penal Code, 1860) as also under Sections 55 (a) (g) (h) (i) , 57A and 58 of the Abkari Act.  We need not refer to the punishments awarded to all these accused persons.  Suffice it to say, that practically all of them were convicted for offences under Section 302, Indian Penal Code, 1860 Section 57A (1) (iii) of the Abkari Act which is a State Act for the State of Kerala.  The accused persons under those Sections were sentenced to suffer rigorous imprisonment for life.  They have also been awarded lesser sentences and have been slapped with heavy fines.  They appealed against this verdict, the conviction and the sentences before the Kerala High Court which has set aside the conviction for offence under Sections 302 and Section 307, Indian Penal Code, 1860, however, maintained the convictions of most of the appellants for offence under Section 57A (1) (ii) under the Abkari Act along with convictions under Sections 324, 326, 328 and 201, Indian Penal Code, 1860 as also the other Sections like Section 55 (h) and (i) and 58 of the Abkari Act.  In short, most of the accused persons were directed to suffer rigorous imprisonment for life and, as the case may be, rigorous imprisonment for 10 years 4 along with fine.  All these appeals were heard jointly since they were against the common judgment.  As many as 48 accused persons came to be tried before the Sessions Judge.  Some of them were acquitted at the stage of trial and some others at the appeal stage, leaving the above mentioned appellants in the fray who are before us.  4.  Alcohol has already proved itself to be one of the major enemies of the human beings.  However, its grip is not loosened in spite of the realization of the evil effects of alcohol on the human life.  On the other hand, the unholy grip is being tightened day by day.  Therefore, when the standard and healthy alcohol in the form of liquor is not available or is too costly for a common man, the poor section of the society goes for illicitly distilled liquor which is sold by the bootleggers.  The conscienceless bootleggers - thanks to their avarice for money - take full advantage of this human weakness and without any compunction or qualms of conscience, distill illicit liquor and then to increase the sale and to gain astronomical profits make their product more potent at least in taste so as to attract the poor customers.  Such poor customers invariably become the prey of such unholy avarice on the part of 5 the bootleggers and in the process even lose their lives at times or suffer such injuries which are irreparable like total blindness etc.  and that is precisely what has happened in this case.  5.  On 2000, in the wee hours, Sub-Inspector of Police, Paripally received information that one Raghunatha Kurup of Kulathoorkonam and seven others were admitted in the Medical College Hospital Thiruvananthapuram for treatment on account of illness caused by consumption of illicit liquor.  He reached the Hospital and recorded the first information statement of Raghunatha Kurup at 2 a.m.  By that time, one Sasidharan who had consumed the illicit liquor had died and two others were lying in unconscious condition.  On that basis, Sub-Inspector registered Crime no.  268 of 2000 under Section 302, 307, Indian Penal Code, 1860 read with Section 34, Indian Penal Code, 1860 and under Section 57A of the Abkari Act.  Little did he know the exact ramifications or vastness of the grim tragedy which was about to take place.  Three other similar crimes were registered at Kottarakkara police station and this was followed by further crimes registered in the same police station being Crime no.809 of 2000, Crime no.810 of 2000, Crime no.811 of 2000 and Crime no.817 of All these crimes were 6 consolidated with crime no.268 of 2000 of Parippally police station and the information started trickling regarding the consumption of spurious liquor by poor persons and their admittance to the hospital from within Anchal and Pooyappally police station limits.  Similar incidents had taken place within the limits of Mangalapuram police station and the crime was registered there also.  Investigation machinery quickly responded to the happenings and a special investigation team (SIT) was constituted as per the directions of Director General of Police, Kerala, Thiruvananthapuram on 2000 which was to be headed by Shri Sibi Mathews, IPS who was the Inspector General of Police.  He was to head the team of seven persons, six other persons being the police officers of the level of Inspectors and above.  All these earlier mentioned crimes were taken over for investigation by SIT.  They started investigation in all the concerned police stations where the crimes were reported.  It was realized that as many as 31 persons had lost their lives, six persons had suffered total blindness in Kollam District whereas more than 500 persons suffered serious injuries on account of the drinking of the illicit liquor.  7 6.  Unfortunately, all this was going on in God's own country, Kerala which was turned into hell by the liquor mafia.  Eventually, investigation by the SIT was completed and the final report was filed before the Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class, Paravoor on 2001 against 47 persons.  After the charge-sheet was filed, accused no.48 was also added by a supplementary charge- sheet.  However, as many as four accused persons, they being accused Nos.  34, 36, 39 and 45 died on account of consumption of their own medicine, the spurious liquor.  Accused no.3 had lost his eye sight completely.  Few accused were absconding, their cases were split up.  Rest of the accused were sent for trial before the Sessions Judge before whom a marathon trial took place wherein 271 witnesses were examined, as many as 1105 documents were proved and relied upon and over 291 material objects were produced.  The defence also examined as many as 17 witnesses and relied on 110 documents being Exhibits D-1 to D- 7.  Prosecution alleged that methyl alcohol which is a poisonous substance used to be brought from Karnataka and mixed with Ethyl alcohol.  At times, this concoction was mixed with toddy and other essences resulting in a drink called Kalapani.  The methyl alcohol used to be 8 mixed with ethyl alcohol which was also illegally and illicitly procured in order to add potency to the drink so that more and more people would purchase the same.  These sales were made from the regularly licensed toddy shops and from other places.  There was well-oiled machinery, huge in proportion, the main component of which was Chandran (accused no.7) who was a toddy contractor.  His brothers, Manikantan (accused no.4) and Vinod Kumar (accused no.8) were deputies helping him.  This group had servants like Balachandran (A-15), the Manager.  Even their wives did not lag behind.  There were laboratories, assistants and labourers.  There were drivers and a fleet of vehicles which were used for importing methyl alcohol from Karnataka and then it used to be brought to the laboratories maintained by Chandran (A-7), Manikantan (A-4) and Vinod Kumar (A-8) where the mixing used to take place.  Accused Nos.  A-4 (Manikantan @ Kochani), A-7 (Chandran @ Manichan), A-8 (Vinod Kumar), A-15 (Balachandran), A-18 (Usha), A-19 (Sugathan), A-20 (Vijayan), A-21 (Rassuludeen), A-22 (Suresh @ Sankaran) and A-23 (Binu @ Monukuttan) were active in firstly procuring the methyl alcohol and then mixing the same in the laboratories and then distributing the same in the whole district, more particularly, to the various outlets for sale of toddy.  9 Chandran (A-7) used to control these shops which were either in his name or some other names.  It was alleged by the prosecution that all these accused persons hatched a criminal conspiracy in or about March, 2000 prior to the auction of toddy shops for the period between 2000-01 and well-oiled machinery was created for importing methyl alcohol from a place called Arihant Chemicals, Bangalore.  Chandran (A-7) controlled toddy shop Nos.1 to 26 of Chirayinkil Panchayat so that there were easy outlets available for the sale of spurious liquor.  Once methyl alcohol was imported, it used to be brought to the huge laboratories constructed for that purpose and carefully concealed which was located at Pandakasala.  It was alleged by the prosecution that Gunasekharan (A-17) purchased two barrels of methyl alcohol as part of the criminal conspiracy from Arihant Chemicals, Bangalore and the same was entrusted to Anil Kumar (A-16) for import to Kerala for the purpose of its mixing with the spirit ethyl alcohol and for sale by Manikantan @ Kochani (A-4), Chandran @ Manichan (A-7), Vinod Kumar (A-8), Balachandran (A-15), Usha (A-18), Sugathan (A-19), Vijayan (A-20), Rassuludeen (A-21), Suresh @ Sankaran (A-22), Binu @ Monkuttan (A-23).  It was brought by Anil Kumar (A-16) in a Fiat car which had fake registration number.  This Fiat car was fitted with 1 a secret tank and thus the poisonous methyl alcohol was imported and was mixed with 56,200 litres of spirit which was also imported to Kerala by Mahesh (A-12), Salil Raj (A-13), Ashraf (A-14) and Sakthi (A-48).  All the mixing was done at Pandakasala and then it was given for distribution to Manikantan (A-4) who transported it through Anil Kumar (A-5), Shibu (A-6), Santhosh @ Kochu Santhosh (A-9), Santhosh @ Valiya Santhosh (A-10), Mohammed Shaji @ Shabu (A-11), knowing it to be injurious to health, through various other vehicles.  8.  The said methyl alcohol which was mixed in the Pandakasala godown meant for toddy shop Nos.1 to 26 of Chirayinkil Panchayat and then got distributed by the above accused persons who all knew very well that it was injurious to health and was fatal.  For this purpose, cars bearing registration no.  PY01M-6582 and TN-1-R 9283 and a Van bearing registration no.  KLOQ-2787 were used.  9.  It was further the case of the prosecution that from this poisonous spirit, 35 litres were taken in a car bearing registration no.

It was alleged that 1 accused Nos.1 and 2 and 3 diluted the spirit by adding water and sold it through their outlets because of which 18 persons died due to consumption of spurious liquor.  It was pointed out that two persons lost their eyesight and number of others sustained grievous injuries.  It was further alleged in the charge that Manikantan (A-4) with the help of Anil Kumar (A-5) and Santhosh (A-10) transported 10 Kannas full of spurious liquor having capacity of 35 litres in the car bearing fake registration no.

The said pouches were also sealed with the help of sealing machine.  Then the pouches were loaded in one Maruti car on the same day and the same was entrusted to A-39, Latha Kumari.  Even these accused knew the spurious nature of the liquor and its lethal effects.  Some liquor out of this was sold to one Soman Pillai and CWs 630 to 634 and on that account Latha Kumari and Soman Pillai died while others suffered serious injuries.  1 10.  It was further alleged by the prosecution that the remaining five Kannas full of spurious liquor were then transported in the car bearing fake registration no.  KL 01M 7444 with the help of accused Nos.  5 and 10 on the same day near the shops of CWs 633 and 664 at Pallikkal in Mylom village at about 45 p.m.  and entrusted the same to A-25 who with the help of some other accused like Sujith (A-24), Dileep (A-26), Shyjan (A-27), Anil Kumar @ Kittu (A-28), Rathy (A-29), Sashikumar (A-32), Shibu (A-33), Rajan (A-34), Sudhakaran (A-35), Pachan (A-36), Santhosh (A-37), Samuel (A-38), Sathyan (A-40), Soman (A-41) sold the spurious liquor at various places in Kottarakkara Taluk at Pallikkal, Kalyanpuram Puthoor and Mylom after diluting the same with water.  Because of the consumption of this liquor, as many as 7 persons died and out of them Rajan (A-34) and Pachan (A-36) also died by consuming the same liquor.  Some others lost their eye sight and still some others sustained grievous injuries.  11.  Another round of 35 litres of kannas was taken by A-4 with the help of all on 2000 in the evening to Attingal Avanavancherry and was sold to A-42 who along with A-47 took the spurious liquor in an auto rickshaw driven by A-47 near the CRPF camp in Thiruvananthpuram 1 District and sold it to A-45 who further sold about 14 litres of spirit to A-44 and 7 litres of spirit to A-46 on 2000 in the evening.  The said liquor was diluted by A-45 with the help of A-43 by mixing water and converted it into arrack and further sold it to a person called Bhaskaran Kutty Nair.  It is alleged that because of the consumption of the same liquor, A-45 himself died while some others suffered grievous injuries.  12.  The prosecution also alleged that A-44 diluted the spirit by adding water and sold it on 2000 near Apollo colony to CWs 433 to They consumed the same liquor and sustained grievous injuries and one of them lost his eyesight.  13.

He was guarded by his two body guards, namely, Constable Dinanath Pawar (PW- 2) and Constable Sandeep Eaghmare (PW-3).  They were armed with a 9 mm pistol and 9 mm carbine with 90 rounds respectively.  The said shed house is an office of Shiv Sena `Shakha'.

Challenge in this appeal is to the judgment of acquittal passed by a Division Bench of the Bombay High Court, Nagpur Bench, allowing the appeal filed by the respondent while answering negatively the reference made by the trial Court for confirmation of death sentence in terms of Section 366 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (in short the `Code').  The respondent was found guilty of offence punishable under Sections 302 and 201 of the Indian Indian Penal Code, 1860, 1860, 1860 (in short the `Indian Penal Code, 1860').  Four persons lost their lives in the night between 19th of August 1998 and 20th of August, 1998.  2.  The case of the prosecution is that one Mahadeo the husband of the first victim Durgabai lived at Katepurna.  His brothers were also living in the same village though in different localities.  Mahadeo committed suicide about three years prior to the incident, leaving his widow Durgabai, daughter Yogita aged about 15 years, son Vinod aged about 12 years and the youngest Maroti aged about 10 years, to stay in the house belonging to Mahadeo.  The house was situated near an open ground where weekly market is held.  In front of the house, there was a Flour Mill and by one side of the house, there appeared to be a row of petty shops, One Laxman Kakad (PW-1) was said to be residing by the side of the Flour Mill.  He was a loner and an old man of 75 years of age, living on whatever help which he received from others by doing their petty jobs like taking the children to the school or doing such sundry works to provide him food and living in a small room.  After the death of Mahadeo, his widow Durgabai and her three children were living in the house and there appeared to be no clear means of survival to these persons and from the evidence of P.  Ramkrishna More (PW-3), the local Police Patil, Durgabai was known in the village as 2 \"quarterwali\", thereby suggesting her association with dealings in liquor, as could be popularly understood, together with people visiting her house because of such reputation of Durgabai.  In this background, the prosecution alleged that the accused Mangilal, of the age of 30 years, developed illicit relations with Durgabai.  The activity did not stop at that stage because of the presence of Yogita, the first daughter of Durgabai.  Slowly, during a span of couple of years, he was said to have developed illicit relations with Yogita and this was the aspect, which was alleged to have been a matter of disturbance to Durgabai.  Though Durgabai tolerated the access of the accused to her, the aspect of access further extending to Yogita, was unacceptable to her and she protested.  It was retaliated by the accused in quarreling with her, which drove her to give a report regarding that sometime on 20th July, 1998 against the accused to the police.  Her grievance was that the accused used to visit her house and was unnecessarily creating quarrels and giving threats to her life because of which she was required to give report against him.  The presence of Durgabai and her two sons - Vinod and Maroti was a matter for irritation to the accused in maintaining his amorous relations with Yogita.  The prosecution also adduced certain material to contend, as its case, that even till the earlier day of the incident, Durgabai had a grievance to make regarding the threats given by the 3 accused to her life and to the lives of her two sons.  In this background, the incident of murders in question occurred.  During the eventful night, the prosecution alleged, that Durgabai had taken care in asking Laxman Kakad to be present in the Chapri' during the night as she needed some support or protection because of apprehension day and and accordingly alongwith her children and Laxman they were all sleeping in the `chapri' covered by the tin shed during that night.  Laxman was said to have woken up on hearing the sound of something being heavily struck.  He got up, and saw the accused present there.  The accused threatened him with consequences similar to the one in which he was engaged.  He was assaulting Durgabai and her children and was killing them.  Laxman saw this, however, due to fear and the threats given by the accused, he had left the place and gone away.   In the next day morning, around 00 a.m.  , the local Police Patil, who was on his usual way of taking round in the village, came across a crowd gathered in front of the house of Durgabai and villagers were looking in the direction of that house, suggestive of some happening which attracted Ramrkishna More (PW-3), the local Police Patil to approach the place and to see the ghastly scene of the country cot, on which Durgabai must have slept, lying with one of its supporting raft broken and the four dead bodies lying there drenched in blood.  The country quilts, which were spread on the bed, were 4 also drenched with blood.  The bodies of three children were lying on the floor by the side of the other cot, as there were two cots; nearby them a heavy object like a grinding stone, domestically used in the kitchen was seen.  Neck of Durgabai was seen to have not only suffered incised wound, but almost it was on the verge of getting separated from rest of the body.  There were incised wounds on the heads of the children, though Yogita's face also seemed to have been smeared with earth and having sunk in the middle suggestive of a fact that it must have been smashed with heavy object.  Having observed this, PW-3, Ramkrishna More, the Police Patil, telephoned by about 00 a.m.  Police Station at Borgaon Manju, a place of about 8 Kms away from Katepurna.  But then by a return response, he was told to go to the police station and lodge his report.  Accordingly, the Police Patil went to the Police Station and lodged his report Exhibit- By that time, the investigating officer - Police Inspector Tayde (PW 19) who seems to be the main figure in investigating the crime and playing a role in collecting the evidence, had reached the spot.  The Police Patil, after lodging the report returned to the spot.  The report was acted upon by the police station, who registered a crime and then from the police station, the original complaint so also the opening of the case diary were despatched to the spot alongwith a Constable.  At about 30 in the noon, Police Inspector Tayde 5 appeared to have given a direction to his Assistant -P.S.I.  Pathan (P.W.  14) to make a search for the accused against whom suspicion was expressed in the F.I.R.  Exhibit-15 and to bring the accused before him.  P.W.14 - P.S.I.  Pathan accordingly had a round in the small village when he came across the accused present at the local bus stand.  The accused was then taken by P.S.I.  Pathan before the Police Inspector who directed P.S.I.  Pathan to take him to the police station, cause his arrest, get him medically examined and to bring him back to the spot, which P.S.I.  Pathan did.  The accused was put under arrest by about 35 p.m.  by taking him to the police station.  P.  Tayde had also given instructions to collect the nail clippings of the accused, which was done by the Medical officer of Borgaon Manju, soon after the arrest of the accused and the nail clippings so collected were then kept in a sealed bottle forwarded by the Medical officer to the Police Station for an eventual chemical analysis.  Requisition to get him medically examined by the local Doctor of the Primary Health Centre at Borgaon Manju was given.  The doctor examined him, and issued a certificate that there were no marks of any fresh injury on the person of the accused.  After the arrest panchnama which was already done and the opinion of Doctor in certifying that no injury mark on the person of the accused was seen by the Doctor, the accused was taken under arrest back to the spot at about 00 6 p.m.  The inquest panchanarna was done and by the time the requisition sent for a dog squad appears to have worked and the dog squad from Amravati arrived at the spot via police station Borfegaon Manju.  The accused was interrogated by Police Inspector Tayde.  The dog squad was said to have worked in its own way.  Smell of certain articles like a tumbler glass, a liquor bottle, small mirror like piece of glass from the spot was given to the dog and the dog was required to track the culprit.  Accordingly, the dog was said to have tracked upto the house of the accused, entered it and then returned.  Since many submissions have been made on the aspect of presence of accused and its effect on the dog squadding, it needs to be mentioned at this stage that the accused was present in the village during the time between 00 p.m.  to 00 p.m.  upto which the recording of the memorandum and the seizure of jersey allegedly at the instance of the accused from out of the septic tank adjoining to his house was said to have been duly done.  On the Memorandum statement, it was the case of the prosecution that accused showed the place near his house where he burnt remains of clothes alongwith the metal hook of pant were discovered so also the place of the septic tank adjoining to his house from which a jersey drenched in the water was removed by means of a hook and the rope and that jersey, on observing the same, appeared to have some stains of blood, 7 which came to be seized before the panchas.  All this took place on 20th August, Obviously, the steps were taken to forward the dead bodies for post mortem examination.  The accused was then taken under arrest back to the police station.  He was produced before the Magistrate and remand was obtained against him for a police custody.  During the course of his police custody, he was further said to have disclosed to the police the place where `Kadbatodi' (Fodder Cutter) was kept/hidden.  Since heavy submissions were made on this aspect as to the purpose of Section 27 of the [Indian Evidence Act, 1872](http://www.liiofindia.org/in/legis/cen/num_act/iea1872125/) (in short the `Evidence Act') the actual utterances of the accused, the authenticity of what was disclosed and what was discovered and whether the entire process was voluntarily at the instance of the accused or was a foisted affair.  What the accused said assumed importance and, therefore, in describing the progress through which the case passed through, investigation steps seemed to have taken place in obtaining police custody, in stating certain grounds for so obtaining the police custody, in getting a clue as admitted by Police Inspector Tayde that during interrogation the accused had given certain information to the police on 21st August, 1998 itself to enlighten the investigating machinery about the place where the weapon was kept hidden, viz.  the same septic tank adjoining to the house of the accused.  In respect of this information, 8 criticism has been made on behalf of the accused regarding the steps which were taken during the investigation.  But as a fact, the Police Inspector endeavoured to state that he learnt about this on interrogation on 23rd August 1998, whereas a Memorandum under Section 27 of the Evidence Act seems to have been recorded on 24th August 1998 pursuant to which the steps which, by that time were already taken in calling a municipal vehicle with a big ladder to get into it and to drain out the water by means of a motor pump, though in actuality the draining out of the water was not done, but by means of a ladder and by means of assistance of a sweeper P.W.10 Ramesh Saude, the weapon, which was said to be `Kadbatodi' was recovered from the septic tank, in which there was obviously a drain water of some level.  The septic tank had an adequate level of water in which the weapon allegedly recovered was said to be lying and through the help of the sweeper the weapon was taken out.  On observation, the prosecution alleges to have collected an evidence regarding traces of the blood stains on the handle at some portion where the blade is fixed to the handle, where there appeared a hole like portion.  The weapon was allegedly seized in the presence of panchas and sealed at the spot of the septic tank from where it was recovered.  As a part of the further steps during the investigation, the articles observed with stains of blood and seized, namely the jersey, the 9 weapon (`Kadbatodi'), nail clippings, blood stained clothes seized from the bodies of victims, samples of the blood of victims were all sent for chemical analysis on 4th October, Prior to that, Dr.  Nikam (PW9) who had performed the post mort examination on the four dead bodies, was required to forward his opinion on observing the weapon, whether the incised wounds observed by him could be caused by that weapon.  As a matter of fact, having regard to the ordinary observations in relation to the weapon and the description of the injuries which were sustained by the victims, we find the circumstance to be so clean enough, that the weapon if used can cause such injuries.  Dr.  Nikam, attached to the General Hospital at Akola, appeared to be on leave for some days although a requisition was said to have been sent to him on 29th August Dr.  Nikam seems to have taken place on 10th September, 1998 and Dr.  Nikam opined that the weapon could cause those incised wounds and by this weapon the fatal injuries sustained by the victims were possible.  During the course of investigation, it appears that the sample of the accused's blood was also collected so also the sample of his sperms.  The blood groups, with which the court is concerned, are of three categories, viz, the blood groups of the victims and the blood group of the accused.  The prosecution did not lead any evidence with respect to the blood group of the accused.  The accused contended that his blood group 10 was \"B\" positive and in his examination under Section 313 of the Code, asserted this fact in giving a written statement and also producing some copies of some certificates and the blood group of the victims was classified by the Chemical Analyser to be \"B\" in relation to victim Durgbai and Yogita and \"O\" in relation to victims Vinod and Maroti.  Chemical Analyser certified that the weapon `Kadbatodi' was noticed to have stains of blood group \"B\".  The jersey was shown to have stains of blood of blood group \"B\".  Nail clippings were found to contain remains of blood of blood group \"B\".  On the strength of the collection of evidence of Laxman Kakad, the eye witness and the four circumstances which have been agitated and finally relied upon by the prosecution to bring its case viz, motive to commit murders founded on illicit relations of the accused with Durgabai and later also with Yogita.  Quarrels and obstruction or resistance in maintaining relations with Yogita driving the accused to form a motive and then the actual incriminating objects such as nail clippings, jersey and `Kadbatodi' discovered at the instance of the information given by the accused, about his knowledge and the place where the articles were kept and his conduct together was said to have enabled the prosecution to file charge sheet against the accused for committing the two crimes in question.  11 Eventually, after initiation of the prosecution upon a charge sheet, the committal of the case to the Court of Sessions, framing of a charge for the two offences, trial was held.  As the case rested on circumstantial evidence the trial Court analysed the various circumstances and came to the conclusion that the respondent accused was responsible for the murder of four persons and accordingly awarded the death sentence.  The respondent questioned his conviction while reference was made for confirmation of death sentence awarded by the trial Court.  As noted above, the High Court found that the circumstances do not make out a case for the conviction.  The High Court found that though PW-1 the eye witness resiled from the statement made during investigation the natural presumption was that he on account of the side of the defence must have been subjected to threaten to his life as a result of which he did not ultimately support the prosecution case.  The High Court found that once PW-1 did not support the prosecution version the case rests on circumstantial evidence.  The High Court found that the circumstances highlighted did not establish a complete chain and, therefore, directed acquittal as noted above.", "statute": ["s3", "s2"]}, "2015.INSC.820.txt": {"doc_url": "http://www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/2015/820/.html", "explanation": {"The appellant addressed a letter dated September 5, 2008 to the President of BCCI and made complaint about the violation of Clause 4 of the Regulations by the respondent no.

Two appeals filed by the appellants were disposed of by a common judgment.  Learned Additional Sessions Judge, Abu Road, Sirohi had convicted the appellant as aforenoted.  2.  Prosecution version in a nutshell is as follows: On 1996 a missing person report about Purshottam Bhai was submitted by Smt.  Jashoda Ben to the Police Inspector, Police Station, Nadiad.  On this application, Inspector Arvindbhai Patel (PW 21) started investigation on Since in the application the name of Jasbhai r/o Nadiar was mentioned so he reached Nadiad and started investigation of the case.  Jasbhai was not found at his home.  His son's wife Rekha met him there and she was interrogated.  On 1996, Jasbhai was found at home and he was interrogated.  The statement of Jasbhai was recorded.  Jasbhai said that Ramesh Patel and Narvar Singh both have cheated him jointly in purchasing his house.  On 1996 the statements of Jashodaben were recorded and copy of the agreement of sale of the house of Jashodaben was submitted.  Thereafter the statements of Rameshbhai and Narpat Singh were recorded.  Both the accused persons Narvar Singh and Ramesh accepted that they had taken Purshottam Bhai and his wife on a visit to Ambaji at Abu Parvat and in Abu Parvat at sunset point they 2 made them drink coffee by pouring sleeping pills in it.  After drinking coffee, Purshottam Bhai became unconscious and he was given five injections of poison.  Jashoda Ben was not unconscious therefore they could not give her injections.  After giving him injections of poison, Purshottambhai died and they wrapped his dead body in a sheet and placed it in the room.  This room was hired at Raghunath Dharamshala.  Therefore Narvat Singh left Dharamshala and Ramesh told Jashoda that Purshottam Bhai had gone to Ambaji alongwith Narvar Singh and he asked her to go to Ambaji.  Taking Jashoda with him, Ramesh came to Ambaji.  Leaving Jashoda alone at Ambaji, both the accused persons fled away.  On 1996 Inspector Arvind Bhai Patel reached Abu Parvat Police Station taking Jasbhai, Ramesh and Narvar Singh with him and in the morning all the three accused persons were handed over to the Abu Parvat Police.  After completion of investigation, charge sheet was filed.  Since accused persons abjured guilt, trial was held.  The trial court found that though the case of the prosecution rested on circumstantial evidence, the circumstances clearly established the accusations.  3 In appeal the High Court upheld the conviction as recorded.  3.

These two appeals have their matrix in a common judgment of a Division Bench of the Madras High Court disposing of three criminal appeals preferred under Section 374 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (in short `Cr.  PC'), against the judgment of the Principal Sessions Judge, Thanjavur in Sessions case no.65 of 1994 dated Five persons had faced trial for alleged commission of murder of one Arunbharathi @ Jynarab (hereinafter referred to as the `deceased').  They were convicted for offences punishable under Section 302 read with Section 34 of the Indian Indian Penal Code, 1860, 1860, 1860 (in short `Indian Penal Code, 1860').  So far as A1, A2 and A5 are concerned, each was sentenced to undergo imprisonment for life.  A1, A2 and A5 were convicted for offence punishable under Section 348 Indian Penal Code, 1860 and sentenced to one year RI each.  A1 was charged for commission of offence punishable under Section 201 Indian Penal Code, 1860 and sentenced to undergo one year RI and A2 and A5 were convicted for offence punishable under Section 201 read with Section 34 Indian Penal Code, 1860 and each was sentenced to undergo RI for life.  2.  A1 was Head Constable, while A2 was a Constable A3 was a Writer, and A4 was a Pere Constable.  All of them were attached to Ammapet Police Station, and they were on duty on 1992 and A5 was a native of Udaiyur Kovil 2 3.  After the case was committed to the Court of Sessions charges were framed since the accused persons pleaded innocence they were put to trial.  In order to substantiate the charges 14 witnesses were examined.  On consideration of the material on record the Trial Court recorded the conviction and imposed sentences as aforesaid.  4.  Stand of the appellant before the High Court was that the deceased had put himself on fire and in fact, all the accused persons immediately quenched the fire and had taken him to the Government Primary Health Hospital, Ammapet, where PW3 doctor was available.  The deceased made a voluntary statement to PW3 wherein he categorically stated that he had poured petrol on himself and set himself on fire.  Thereafter the deceased with the burn injuries was taken to the Medical College Hospital where also he made a similar statement to PW4 the doctor.  Subsequently, another doctor PW6 examined him where also he made a similar statement.   Therefore, it 3 was submitted that the Trial Court was not justified in convicting them relying on the purported dying declaration alleged to have been given by the deceased to the Revenue Divisional Officer (PW14) on 1992 i.e.  four days prior to his death.  The same was nothing but a tutored one.  The High Court held that the so called statements made before the doctors cannot be accepted in view of the dying declaration recorded by PW14 the RDO.  The High Court did not attach any importance to the statements purportedly given before PWs, 3, 4 and 6 and also relied on the dying declaration purportedly made by the deceased before the PW The High Court found that the allegations against A2, A3 were not proved beyond reasonable doubt and they were entitled to acquittal.  Accordingly, the appeals filed by these accused persons were allowed and those filed by the appellants in these two appeals were dismissed.  4 5.  In support of the appeal learned counsel for the appellants submitted that the High Court proceeded on presumptions that because the statements of the deceased to PWs, 3, 4 and 6 were made in the presence of a Constable, therefore, they were not voluntary.  On the contrary at the time when the statements were made, the relatives of the deceased were present is evident from the evidence of PW1 who took the deceased to the hospital.  He had categorically admitted that he was accompanied by several persons when the deceased was taken to and was at the hospital.  PW1 and others were there with him.  PW1 has categorically admitted that this was the situation in the Ammapet hospital and Thanjavur Medical College Hospital.  He has categorically stated that several persons were present at the hospital.  It was, therefore, submitted that the voluntary statement made right from the beginning should not have been lightly brushed aside.  It is also pointed out that the High Court came to an erroneous conclusion by misreading dying declaration purported to be made before RDO that it was either A1 or A5 5 (the present appellants) who had poured petrol and set him on fire.  6.  In response, learned counsel for the respondent-State submitted that the High Court had rightly relied upon the dying declaration made before the RDO.

The deceased-Latha and the appellant herein got married to each other on 20th March, 2003. The prosecution version is that the deceased-Latha and her husband the appellant herein lived happily for a few months after their marriage in March 2003 during which time Latha conceived and gave birth to a female child. The marital relationship, however, soured when the appellant developed illicit relations with one Sarpina @ Sarfunnisa arrayed as accused no.2 before the Trial Court. The deceased-Latha, but naturally took exception to this relationship and informed her parents about the same who had a panchayat convened in the village to resolve the matter. The panchayat, according to the prosecution, advised the appellant to end his relationship with Sarpina, his paramour, which the appellant agreed to do.  That commitment was however observed but only in breach as the illicit relationship between the appellant and Sarpina continued resulting in frequent quarrels between the appellant and the deceased-Latha. The prosecution case is that although the parents of the deceased had given dowry articles to the deceased including a sum of rupees one lakh towards cash, the appellant was demanding more money for purchase of a site. In order to satisfy that demand, the parents of the deceased had mortgaged their land and paid a sum of Rs.50,000/- to the appellant. It is also alleged that the appellant was neglecting the deceased and was residing with Sarpina, accused no.2. The deceased was provoked by this conduct and is alleged to have gone to the house of Sarpina (A-2) to lodge her protest in an attempt to wean the appellant away from the illicit relationship.  This provoked the appellant, who assaulted the deceased. The parents of the deceased had in that background taken the deceased away to her parental home with her minor child. The prosecution case is that a day prior to the incident the parents of the deceased brought the deceased-Latha back to her matrimonial home in village Lakya, but the appellant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cruel behaviour towards her continued unabated. On the fateful day, the deceased appears to have asked the appellant to pay her some money so that she could take her sick child to the doctor. The appellant is alleged to have asked her to come to the field, where the appellant was going for work to collect the money. According to the prosecution, Latha followed her husband to the field while her parents returned to their village, but only to receive by evening the sad news that their daughter was lying dead under a tamarind tree near the land of the appellant in his village. They rushed to the village and the place of occurrence only to find that the deceased had died of strangulation.

He went to the school on 3.08.2000.  His parents are owner of a factory situated in Daman.  The appellant admittedly was appointed as a driver by them and worked for about three months.  At around 6.15 p.m. on the said date, a phone call was attended by Alpa,mother of the deceased.  When she heard the caller, she started weeping at which point their neighbour Khimjibhai picked up the phone and from other end he was informed that the boy was in their custody.  A demand of Rs. 25 lakhs was made as ransom money for returning the child safely.  Ashwin, father of Paras, thereafter went to the police station and lodged a complaint.  A few calls demanding ransom were received in the next two days.  Ashwin was asked to come to a place near Ankleshwar with the amount of ransom in his Armada Car.  Further instructions as to how money should be handed over were also furnished.  A trap was arranged at Ankleshwar but nobody turned up to claim the amount of ransom.  When a query was made as to whether he knew a person who was a resident of Ankleshwar, the name of the appellant was disclosed.  He was arrested and on conducting a search his personal diary was seized.  He made a confession that the boy had been murdered.  He made a statement which led to recovery of a few bones on 7.08.2000 at about 4.00 p.m.from a nalla.

Further, the case of the prosecution reveals that on 29th September, 2003, at about 00 p.m. the victim Archideb Bhattacharjee had started from his house on his Avon bicycle to visit one Chandan Dey of Ghola Gouranganagor for making tagada in connection with his business and he started back therefrom at about 00 p.m. for returning to his home but on his way back, he was restrained by the accused persons near Goshala Field at about 30 p.m. and was assaulted by them. The accused persons strangulated him and ultimately he was murdered by them on the midnight of 29th/30th September, With the intention to cause disappearance of evidence of the said murder, the accused persons subsequently severed the head, legs, hands and body of the corpse by a sharp cutting weapon and after putting the same in gunny bags, carried it in a Maruti Van at about 00 p.m. on the following day i.e. 30th September, 2003 and left the same at Pathulia Danga-dingla by the side of Barrackpore Dum Dum Highway near the Electric Tower and in front of the garden of Tapan Santra. Subsequently, as already noticed, at about 00 p.m. on that day these two sacks containing the dismembered and beheaded corpse were noticed by PW15 who then reported the matter to the Police. 7. Since Archideb Bhattacharjee did not return to his home after visiting Chandan Dey on the night of 29th September, 2003, his wife and elder brother had gone to the house of Chandan Dey at Ghola where they came to know that at about 00 p.m. he had left for his own home after collecting the money from him. Having come to know of that fact, the wife and brother of the deceased went to the Police Station and lodged a missing diary report being G.D. no.1163 dated 30th September, 2003 whereafter, as already noticed, they were called to the Police Station for identifying the dead body of Archideb Bhattarcharjee on 1st October, 2003. During the course of investigation, it was also revealed that before the date of occurrence, the eight accused persons led by Uttam Das, Panchanan and Mou @ Dipak had demanded rs.40,000/- from Archideb Bhattarcharjee towards Tola Mastani Salami in relation to construction of six shop rooms on his own land for letting the same. Archideb had refused to succumb to this illegal demand. The accused persons had then threatened him with dire consequences. Archideb Bhattarcharjee was once called to the premises of the local East Bengal Bayam Samiti Club also where he was threatened. The accused persons had also visited the house of Archideb several times for demanding money and, lastly, they had come to the house of Archideb on 27th September, 2003 and threatened that if their demand of rs.40,000/- was not fulfilled within one day, they would murder him. 8. On 1st October, 2003, the driver of the Maruti Van, namely, Manik Das was arrested by the Police on the basis of a telephonic information that dead body of the deceased was carried in the said Maruti Van.

The deceased in turn had thrown his cycle and fled into the fields of the wheat crop being followed by the appellants. It is alleged that in the presence of the witness, Baldev Singh had given a blow from the sharp side of his `Kapa' on the left wrist of the deceased while Major Singh gave blows with Kirpan one after the other, as a result of which Kashmir Singh fell down. Shingara Singh then caught hold of the deceased by his hair, who had tried to catch hold of the Kirpan of Major Singh and in that process he had received injuries on the fingers of his left hand. Thereafter, Baldev Singh caught hold of the arm of the deceased and Major Singh severed his head with a blow of the Kirpan.

In order to understand the controversy raised in the instant cases it will be relevant to notice the essential facts emerging from record of the case.  The BCCI was formed in the year Initially it was functioning as an unregistered association of persons.  However, subsequently it was registered in the year 1940, under the [Societies Registration Act, 1860](http://www.liiofindia.org/in/legis/cen/num_act/sra1860259/).  After the enactment of the Tamil Nadu Societies Registration Act, 1975, which came into effect from April 22, 1978, it is registered under the said Act.  Under Section 6 of the Act of 1975, any society seeking to register itself has to submit its Memorandum of Association and regulations/bye-laws/rules.  In respect of BCCI, the Memorandum of Associations and the Regulations/Rules, as required by the said Act, have been submitted.  The record of the case shows that registration of BCCI as a Society is governed by those two documents.  The object of BCCI is to control the game of cricket in India and give its decision on all matters which may be referred to it.  Another object is to encourage the formation of State, regional or other cricket associations in the country.  The other objects have been enumerated in detail in the Memorandum of Association, but the Court is of the opinion that it is not necessary to make a detailed reference to the same.  The respondent no.  1, i.e.  , the BCCI sent an invitation to India Cements Limited based at Chennai and represented by its Managing Director Mr.  N.  Srinivasan, who is respondent no.  2 herein, on December 29, 2007, to participate in the auction conducted by IPL.  It may be mentioned that at that time the respondent no.  2 was also the Honorary Treasurer of BCCI and the President of Tamil Nadu Cricket Association.  The respondent no.  2, on behalf of India Cements Limited, participated in the auction and was awarded the franchised IPL rights for ownership of Chennai Super Kings team by the BCCI.  4.  The appellant is the Ex-President of BCCI.  According to him, he is an administrator as defined in Clause 1(n) of the Regulations framed by BCCI.  The appellant addressed a letter dated September 5, 2008 to the President of BCCI and made complaint about the violation of Clause 4 of the Regulations by the respondent no.  In the said letter it was claimed by the appellant that the respondent no.  2 was liable to be penalized since he is the Managing Director of India Cements Limited, which was one of the franchisee of IPL and IPL being an event of BCCI, the respondent no.  2 had thereby acquired commercial interest and violated the terms of Clause 4 of the Regulations.  The appellant wrote another letter on September 19, 2008 to the President of BCCI reiterating his grievance against the respondent no.  2 and urged the then President of BCCI to take action against the respondent no.  Since no action was taken by the President of the BCCI on the complaints submitted by the appellant, the appellant has filed Civil Suit no.  930 of 2008 in the High Court of Madras at Chennai seeking a permanent injunction to restrain BCCI from permitting the respondent no.  2 to participate in the General Body Meeting scheduled in Mumbai on September 27, 2008 or on any other subsequent date, which would be convened in relation to election of new office bearers.  The appellant has also sought permanent mandatory injunction directing BCCI to initiate inquiry under clause 32(ii) of the Regulations, by appointing a Commissioner to make a preliminary inquiry against the respondent no.

In the fardbeyan, it was stated: Father of the informant, namely Ravindra Prasad, was running a tea stall near the Eastern gate of the GPO.  For the tea stall he required about 25 Litres of milk everyday and this milk was being supplied by Sanaullah Khan, the appellant herein, for about a month.  Sanaullah Khan started mixing water with the milk and the customers of the tea stall started making complaints about the quality of tea.  On 2002 at about 00 p.m.  Sanaullah Khan along with Md.  Hamid and Arvind came to the tea stall and demanded the dues for the supply of milk.  After calculation it was found that the dues amounted to rs.  1,000/- and Ravindra Prasad gave Sanauallah Khan rs.  500/- and told him that the rest of the amount will be paid later.  Ravindra Prasad, however, informed Sanaullah Khan that the milk supplied by him was not up to the mark and therefore he will no longer purchase milk from his Khatal.  Sanaullah Khan got annoyed and told him that he will not allow him to run the tea stall.  Ravindra Prasad retorted that he had seen many persons like him at his tea stall.  Sanaullah Khan said that he will have to face serious consequences and that he will teach him a lesson within two to four days.  Thereafter, Sanaullah Khan, Hamid and Arvind went away.  On 2002 at about 00 p.m.  Arvind, who was working with Sanaullah Khan came and told Ravindra Prasad that his master was calling him for some urgent work and Ravindra Prasad went along with Arvind and did not return for an hour.  Arvind again came and told his brother Sunny Kumar, who was in the tea stall, that his master was calling him and that Ravindra Prasad was in the Khatal.  Sunny Kumar also accompanied Arvind.  Ravindra Prasad and Sunny Kumar, however, did not return till the next morning.  The Informant became suspicious and started searching for his father and his brother.

The High Court though dismissed the appeal qua appellant no.1, Pawan Kumar but as regards the appellant Nos.  2 and 3, sentences were reduced to six months under both counts respectively and it is this order of dismissal which is under challenge before this Court in the appeal by the grant of special leave.  Before adverting to the rival contentions, be it noted that the entire matter hinges on circumstantial evidence.@@ JJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ There is also however existing on record, a dying@@ JJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ declaration, but its effect on the matter, shall be discussed shortly hereafter in this judgment.  Incidentally success of the prosecution on the basis of circumstantial evidence will however depend on the availability of a complete chain of events so as not to leave any doubt for the conclusion that the act must have been done by the accused person.  While however, it is true that there should be no missing links, in the chain of events so as far as the prosecution is concerned, but it is not that every one of the links must appear on the surface of the evidence, since some of these links may only be inferred from the proven facts.  Circumstances of strong suspicion without however any conclusive evidence are not sufficient to justify the conviction and it is on this score that great care must be taken in evaluating the circumstantial evidence.  In any event, on the availability of two inferences, the one in favour of the accused must be accepted and the law is well settled on this score, as such we need not dilate much in that regard excepting however, noting the observations of Srivastava [(AIR 1992 SC 840)](/cgi- bin/LawCite?cit=AIR%201992%20SC%20840) wherein this Court in paragraph 9 of the report observed:- The Court has, time out of number, observed that while appreciating circumstantial evidence the Court must adopt a very cautious approach and should record a conviction only if all the links in the chain are complete pointing to the guilt of the accused and every hypothesis of innocence is capable of being negatived on evidence.  Great care must be taken in evaluating circumstantial evidence and if the evidence relied on is reasonably capable of two inferences, the one in favour of the accused must be accepted.  The circumstance relied upon must be found to have been fully established and the cumulative effect of all the facts so established must be consistent only with the hypothesis of guilt.  But this is not to say that the prosecution must meet any and every hypothesis put forward by the accused however far-fetched and fanciful it might be.  Nor does it mean that prosecution evidence must be rejected on the slightest doubt because the law permits rejection if the doubt is reasonable and not otherwise.  The other aspect of the issue is that the evidence on record, ascribed to be circumstantial, ought to justify the inferences of the guilt from the incriminating facts and circumstances which are incompatible with the innocence of the accused or guilt of any other person.  The observations Punjab ( AIR 1987 SC 350) lends concurrence to the above.  Referring to the prosecution case at this stage it appears that Ekta, the sister of Sudarshan Kumar was married to Pawan Kumar appellant no.  After four months of the marriage, Ekta went to Sudarshan Kumar alongwith her husband Pawan Kumar and told him that a sum of rs.10,000/- was being demanded by Pawan Kumar, his father and mother.  Sudarshan promised to pay that amount after a couple of days after arranging for it.  Accordingly, three days thereafter Sudarshan accompanied by one Jag Pal Saini went to the house of the accused at Shahbad and paid the amount of rs.000/- to Smt.  Kaushalya Devi.  After about one year, Ekta again came to the house of Sudarshan with a definite grievance about being pestered for money by her husband and parents- in-law.  At that time, she stayed at the house of Sudarshan for eight months and never wanted to go back by reason of consistent harassment with beating.  As a matter of fact, a feeling of being fed up together with despondency has completely over-powered her.  Subsequently, a panchayat was held and at the asking of village Panchayat, Sudarshan agreed to send and did send Ekta with Ram Asra to the house of her parents-in-law at Shahbad.  However, the appellants continued harassing Ekta for dowry.highlight1  highlight0 Sudarshan came to know of this fact whenever he visited Ekta at Shahbad and as and when she came to meet her parents at karera Khurd.  It is further the case of the prosecution that about two months prior to the occurrence, Sudarshan booked a maruti van for himself and appellant-Pawan Kumar came to know about it.  He went to the house of Sudarshan and told him that either the said van be given to him or he may book another van for him.  Sudarshan however, refused to accede to the demand.  Pawan Kumar went back leaving the impression that it would not bring good result.  On 1985, Sudarshan received a telephonic message that Ekta was burnt.  Sudarshan, accompanied by Dr.  Krishan Lal, Sham Sunder and mother of Ekta went to Shahbad.  On reaching Shahbad, they came to know that Ekta had been taken to P.G.I.  , Chandigarh by the accused.  Sudarshan along with his companions reached P.G.I.  , Chandigarh and found that Ekta had died.  He took the dead body and brought it to Shahbad and lodged a report to the police.  The report was recorded by ASI Fateh Singh and he took up the investigation of the case.  He reached at the spot.  At that time, the kitchen of the house was locked and one ASI was put on guard.  The dead body along with the inquest report was sent for post mortem examination.  On the next day, the spot and the dead body were got inspected by the team summoned from Forensic Science Laboratory, Madhuban.  Thereafter, the ASI inspected the spot himself and prepared a rough site plan.  He took into possession certain articles, which were sealed.  The statements of other witnesses were recorded.  The appellants were arrested.  On the completion of investigation, challan was filed.  Thereafter the case was committed to the Court of Sessions where the learned Additional Sessions Judge tried it and the conviction as above was made by him.  Incidentally, the defence has also led evidence to show that Ekta died of an accident and not a suicidal death and on this score strong reliance was placed on the dying declaration by Ekta made before the Police Officer.  Though, however, dying declaration is stated to be a got up document and not worth even the paper on which it was written.  The same is however noted herein below.  I was married with Pawan Kumar S/o Ram Asra caste Arora R/o Sainda Mohalla, Shababad about 4-5 years before.  My husband is cloths dealer and his shop is situated in Main Bazar Shahabad.  We live together with our parents-in-law.  Today in morning at about 30 AM my husband and my father-in-law Ram Asra had already been gone at shop and my mother-in-law Smt.  Kaushalaya Devi also had gone to the house of neighbour for visit.  I was alone at house.  Today at about 10 AM I was boiling the Milk in Kitchen on a stove kerosene Oil was finished from the stove.  It had taken a bottle of kerosene oil which was lying in kitchen for filling up in stove.  Then that bottle of kerosene oil fell down from my hands and broken.  The kerosene oil from the bottle fell upon my cloths and on the burns stove, so that reason my cloths get on fire on this I started crying on this a number of persons and women came to the spot.  They put off the fire from my clothes and from body.  Later on my husband reached there.  I was brought in Civil Hospital Shahabad for treatment.  This fire set on due to broken the bottle of kerosene.  No body have fault in this matter.  This fire was put on by chance and not I had put on fire by anybody.  Statement heard and it is correct.  Attested LTI, Ekta Rani Sd/- Arun Kumar,ASI, PS Shahabad W/o Pawan Kumar 85 Mr.  Sushil Kumar, learned Senior Advocate contended that the sole issue in the matter under consideration is whether the death of Ekta can be ascribed to be an accidental death or a case of suicide? Needless to record that the High Court negated the case of accidental death and held the appellants guilty of abetment to the act of suicide and it is on this count that the appeal of the appellant no.1 before the High Court was rejected whereas the two other appellants had their sentences reduced.  In support of the appeal it has rather emphatically been contended that the dying declaration itself would negate any suicidal act, but depicted a clear accidental incident resulting in the death.  It is this dying declaration which the learned Trial Judge, as also the High Court ascribed it to be not worth the paper on which the same was written and does not deserve the credence of acceptance of the same.  Peculiarities are the ways which can however, easily be noticed: The kerosene on the stove got finished as a result of which further filling of kerosene was required and hence a bottle was taken, which accidentally slipped out and broken.  But the factum of the stove not having any kerosene, has been ignored, since absence of kerosene would put off the ignition and there would be total extinguishment of fire: The resultant effect of such an extinguishment mean and imply that one would require a match stick to ignite the kerosene- since there is no automatic flow of fire available.  The fact, Ekta died of burn injuries stands admitted which has been stated to be accidental and not suicidal.  It is on this score however, the prosecution laid evidence to depict that the accident could not have happened as stated in the dying declaration and it has been an evidence created to cover up the suicide.  Strong reliance has been placed on the evidence of Senior Scientific Officer Shri J.L.  Gaur (PW.2) who in no uncertain terms ruled out any accidental burn injury in the matter.  On an examination of the body it was observed that a part of the scalp, hair on the top of head eye brow, eye lashes and public hair were burnt and singed.  However hairs on the sides and back of the head had escaped any injury.  The body was burnt practically all over excepting the feet and their soles.  Three kerosene stoves were available in the kitchen, two being with sufficient fuel for use and the other one lying totally idle in another corner of the room with accumulation of dust on them.  In any event, the third stove lying in the other corner was not having even a smell of kerosene.  Pieces of broken glass bottle with no smell of kerosene were available in the kitchen and one of the bottom piece of bottle had fungus like deposit clearly indicating non user of the bottle as a container of kerosene for quite sometime.  Significantly, there was a match box, a broken match box lying on the floor at a distance of about four feet from the stove.  The used sticks of match box were available near the stove.  The match box emitted smell of kerosene.  PW.2 has also spoken of non-availability of any milk or milk container even in the kitchen.  The further finding of PW.2 is that both the stoves were in working condition and the air pressure valves of the stove were found in open position having the lids of the tanks of the stove dry and tightly closed.  PW 2 further spoke of an unused funnel lying on the floor of the room which also did not have any kerosene smell.  It is for reasons as above that learned Sessions Judge and the High Court refused to put any credence on the defence of accidental burn injury.  If the accidental injury is ruled out and which we also feel the same way as that of the other two Courts, the obvious conclusion would be suicidal death and on that issue a further question arises as regards abetment.  An analysis of the evidence of PW.3, Sudarshan Kumar (brother of the deceased) depicts the behavioural pattern received at the in-laws place by Ekta.  Occasional demand for money and failure to meet the same, however resulted in beating up of the girl, Ekta, and as a matter of fact in September 1985 she came back to the house of complainant all alone and this arrival, the complainant described as the aftermath of torture which in fact did put her up in a bad shape.  Definite evidence is available on record that Ekta stayed with the complainant for about 8 months and it is only thereafter the appellant no.2 wanted to take back Ekta.  The brother of complainant PW.3 however, pointedly refused though after some persuasion and assurance of the father-in- law, in the presence of some other members of the family, of proper treatment to the daughter-in-law, the complainant agreed and Ekta thus went back to the in-laws place.  Further evidence however, records that there has been no improvement of the behavioural pattern and she was subjected to dowry torture as also various abusive treatment by reason of not being able to bear a child.  Incidentally, the two families, namely the brides and grooms, related to each other and it is on this score that learned Senior Advocate in support of the appeal contended that dowry torture or even user of any abusive language were all figments of imagination : The evidence however tell a different story - The torture continued and reached its peak in July 1985 by reason of a booking of a Maruti Van by the complainant which was asked to be delivered to the accused/appellant, on refusal however, to comply with the demand for delivery of the van by the complainant, the relationship was further estranged and PW 3 was given a warning as regards the events to follow and it is only thereafter this incident of burn injury took place.  A number of relatives were also examined and their evidence corroborate this state of affairs as narrated by the complainant PW.  The learned Senior Advocate in support of the appeal further contended that the factum of the hospitalization of Ekta in any event negates any ill treatment or torture, but to be treated as a positive evidence of goodwill and affection.  We are however unable to record our concurrence therewith having due regard to the evidence and other materials available on record.  There is thus preponderance of evidence of dowry torture and it is on this count that Section 113(A) of the Evidence Act ought to be taken note of Section 113(A) reads as below:- 113(A).  Presumption as to abetment of suicide by a married woman.- When the question is whether the commission of suicide by a woman had been abetted by her husband or any relative of her husband and it is shown that she had committed suicide within a period of seven years from the date of her marriage and that her husband or such relative of her husband had subjected her to cruelty, the Court may presume, having regard to all the other circumstances of the case, that such suicide had been abetted by her husband or by such relative of her husband.  Explanation;- For the purposes of this Section, cruelty shall have the same meaning as in Section 498-A of the Indian Indian Penal Code, 1860, 1860 (45-1860).  Incorporation of Section 113(A) of the Evidence Act in the statute book, depicts a legal presumption though however the time period of within seven years of marriage is the pre-requisite for such a presumption.  The circumstances as noticed hereinbefore in the contextual facts and the materials on record substantiate the requirements of Section 113 (A) and having regard to the language used in Section 498 A of the Indian Indian Penal Code, 1860, 1860 there cannot be any hesitation in coming to a finding that cruelty is written large as regards the conduct of the appellant herein towards Ekta.  Needless to state that Section 113(A) itself by way of an explanation provides that cruelty shall have the same meaning as is attributed under Section 498(A) of the Indian Indian Penal Code, 1860, 1860 which reads as below:- (a) any willful conduct which is of such a nature as is likely to drive the woman to commit suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to life, limb or health(whether mental or physical) of the woman; or (b) harassment of the woman where such harassment is with a view to coercing her or any person related to her to meet any unlawful demand for any property or valuable security or is on account of failure by her or any person related to her, to meet such demand.", "statute": ["s6", "s3"]}, "2006.INSC.863.txt": {"doc_url": "http://www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/2006/863/.html", "explanation": {"a dead body was recovered, which was ultimately found to be that of Sushil Kumar.": ["s2"], "The dead body of Sudhir Kumar was thereafter found.": ["s3"]}, "fact": " STATE OF M.P [2006] INSC 863 (24 November 2006) sectionB.

Interpretation and application of Section 31 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 is involved in this appeal, which arises out of a judgment and order dated 3rd February, 2004 passed by a learned Single Judge of the Madhya Pradesh High Court at Jabalpur in Criminal Appeal no.2665 of In view of the question involved herein, we need not dilate on the factual matrix of the matter in great details.  Suffice it say that the appellant herein was proceeded against in a case involving kidnapping of two boys Sudhir Kumar and Sushil Kumar, aged about 10 to 12 years.  They were sons of Ramakant Katiyar (P.W.6).  They had gone to attend school at about 30 in the morning of 29th December, They were to return at about 30 p.m.  , but, when they did not return till 30 p.m.  , a search for them was made.  After the informant came back home, he was informed by his wife that one of the classmate of the boys, namely, Gulabchandra Gour (P.W.7), had delivered his school bag informing that Satyendra (P.W.10) had asked him to do the same.  P.W.6 went to the house of Satyendra to make inquiries about his son and came to learn that victim Sudhir Kumar had come to his house and handed over the bag stating that he was proceeding towards the farm.  A First Information Report was lodged.  Allegedly, the Chowkidar of the school, namely, Ramesh Kumar (P.W.8) discovered certain wearing apparels as also a letter demanding ransom of rs.2,000/-.  He handed over the trouser and the letter to the police.  On the next day, one Prakash Chandra Sharma came to the house of Ramakant and stated that he had found a letter in which it was stated that P.W.6 had committed a grave error in intimating the police.  Therein it was, allegedly, mentioned that dead body of Sunil Kumar was thrown in the 'nallah' behind the 'durgha'.  A search was made, but the dead body was not found.  Allegedly, a demand of rs.10,000/- towards ransom was made by a letter, which was marked as Exhibit P/ On 1995, a dead body was recovered, which was ultimately found to be that of Sushil Kumar.  P.W.6 received another letter on 1995, whereby he was asked to pay a sum of rs.20,000/-.  In that letter it was said to have written that if the said amount was not paid, Sudhir Kumar would be similarly dealt with.  The dead body of Sudhir Kumar was thereafter found.  During investigation, appellant was apprehended and ultimately, he was prosecuted for alleged commission of offences under Section 302, 201, 364, 365 and 120-B of the Indian Indian Penal Code, 1860, 1860, 1860 ('Indian Penal Code, 1860', for short).

She had inherited huge properties including House No. 81, Richmond Road, Bangalore from her mother. She had inherited some other properties during her marriage. Some litigations in respect of the said properties had been going on.  2. Mr. Khaleeli on his assignment as diplomat of Iran went to the said country.

However, despite her marriage with the appellant, the deceased was maintaining her relationship with her parents and daughters. Mrs. Sabah Khaleeli, second daughter of the deceased (PW-5) had all along been in touch with her.  3. It is not in dispute that from 28.05.1991, the deceased was not seen.  PW-5 had been trying to contact her on phone. She was informed by the appellant that the deceased had gone to Hyderabad. In June 1991, when contacted, she was informed that her mother had gone to Kutch to attend a wedding. A week thereafter it was informed to her that the deceased had been lying low owing to some income tax problems. She, being exasperated with the said explanations, came down to Bangalore. She did not find her mother there. She was told that the deceased being pregnant had gone to United States of America for delivery of the child. She was told to have been admitted in Roosevelt Hospital. She made verifications thereabout through her acquaintances and came to know that no such woman had ever been admitted to the said hospital. Appellant being confronted thereto, informed her that the deceased had gone to London as she had wanted to keep it as a secret. However, in 1992, when she met the accused at Mumbai, noticed the passport of her mother lying in the room of the hotel which confirmed that the deceased had not visited USA or London as represented to her by the appellant on earlier occasions.  He stated in great details as to the manner in which he had killed his wife and disposed of her dead body.

J.  These two appeals are directed against the judgment and order of Kerala High Court dated 1991 in Criminal Appeal no.  370 of Vijayan @ Rajan appellant in Criminal Appeal no.  43 of 1992 alongwith Sadanandan appellant in Criminal Appeal no.  753 of 1991 were tried in the Court of Session Judge Hmakulam for having committed the offence under Sections 120B, 109, 447, 302 and 201 read with Section 34 of the Indian Indian Penal Code, 1860, 1860 and also under Sections 35 and 25 of the Indian Arms Act for the murder of Majeendran by means of a revolver.  The learned Sessions judge acquitted both the accused persons.  On an appeal being carried by the State, the High Court by the impugned judgment has set aside the order of acquittal passed by the learned Sessions Judge and convicted Vijayan of the charge under Section 302 read with 120B(1) of the Indian Indian Penal Code, 1860, 1860 and sentenced each of them to imprisonment for life and hence these two appeals.  The prosecution case is that the two appellants entered into a criminal conspiracy to cause death of Majeendran who was residing in the city of Cochin Pursuant to the said conspiracy and being instigated by caused Sadanandan, Vijayan went to the house of Majeendran at 00 a.m.  On 1981 and fired two shots at him from a revolver.  One of the side shot hit the chest of Majeendran and immediately after firing Vijayan left the place.  Majeendran was then first taken to the hospital by some of the neighbors and then to the Medical Trust Hospital where he succumbed to the injuries at about 10 a.m.  The motive alleged by the prosecution was that Sadanandan was a rising abkari contractor and PW 50 who was uncle of Sadanandan was giving financial help to him.  Deceased Majeendran was in business and had received finances from said PW Sadanandan was perturbed on account of this, thinking that his uncle would no more render the same financial help for his business and as such he conspired with Vijayan and gave him a revolver and instigated him to punish Majeendran which he did on the fateful day during the early hours.  Sadanandan was arrested on Vijayan surrendered before the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Emakulam on Though the prosecution examined as many as 70 witnesses and exhibited 110 documents to bring home the charge against the accused persons but there is no eye witness to the said occurrence.  The prosecution, however, relied upon the circumstantial evidence.  The learned Sessions Judge examined each of the circumstance which the prosecution relied upon and ultimately came to the conclusion that the circumstances those established do not complete the chain for bringing home the charges against the accused persons and accordingly acquitted both the appellant of all charges levelled against them.  The High Court by the impugned judgment, however, re-appreciated the circumstantial evidence and being of the conclusion that the circumstances those established complete the chain pointing the guilt of the accused recorded the conviction of the two appellants.  Mr.  Lalit, learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant Vijayan submitted that the High Court committed serious error in relying upon the evidence of PW3 to come to the conclusion that she saw accused Vijayan on the early hours of the date of occurrence and reliance upon such circumstance is wholly unsustainable.  Mr.  Lalit also submitted that a bare reading of the judgment of the High Court would indicate that the Court was persuaded to come to a conclusion that the prosecution has been able to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt because of the sensation it created in the locality rather than on a proper appreciation of the evidence on record.  Mr.  Lalit also submitted that the learned Sessions Judge having discussed each of the circumstance sought to be established by the prosecution and having given good reasons for not accepting those circumstances the High Court was duty bound to consider those reasons and non-consideration of those reasons has vitiated the impugned judgment of the High Court by way of interference with the order of acquittal.  Mr.  Gopal Subramaniam, learned senior counsel appearing for accused Sadanandan submitted that there is not an iota of material in support of establishing a charge of conspiracy under Section 120B and the High Court, therefore, committed serious error by convicting Sadanandan on a charge of conspiracy by mere conjectures and not by any legal evidence.  Mr.  Raju Ramachandran, learned senior counsel appearing for the State, however, submitted that the evidence of PW3 could be relied upon even if lest Identification Parade is discarded and if her evidence is accepted then the prosecution case is proved that it was accused Vijayan who came on the date of occurrence during early hours and shot at the deceased.  According to Mr.  ramachandran the evidence of Pws 3,4 and 9 Mr.  Ramachandran the evidence of PWs 3,4, and 9 infect constitute a complete chain of events pointing out the guilt of the accused, and therefore, the High Court was fully justified in recorded the conviction of the appellants.  To test the correctness of the rival submissions it would be necessary for us to examine the circumstances relied upon by the High Court and to find out whether on the materials on record it is possible to hold such circumstances have been established and then to find out whether all such circumstances taken together can be said to be complete which point to the guilt of the accused rather than their innocence.  It is not in dispute that the deceased Majeendran was shot an by somebody in his own house during early hours of 9th Oct.  1981 and on account of such gun shot injury he succumbed.  PW3 was the maid servant of the deceased and according to her evidence during the early hours when somebody gave a call bell she went out and found a man standing and wanted her master to come but she replied that master get up late.  Even thereafter when the man again gave the bell she got up and opened the door and then called the master and shortly thereafter she heard the sound and when she went back she did not find the man who dad earlier given the bell and during her evidence in Court she identified the man to be accused Vijayan.  Accused Vijayan on being surrendered was arrested on 84 and the Test Identification Parade was held on This Test Identification Parade was discarded by the learned Sessions Judge as it was apparent from the evidence of PW3 that the photograph of accused Vijayan was shown to her before the Test Identification Parade and further just before she was entering the Sub-jail to identity the accused somebody had told her to identify the tallest man shown in the parade.  The High Court also agreed with the conclusion of the learned Sessions Judge and did not rely upon the same but queerly enough the High Court relied upon the evidence of PW3 as she identified the accused in Court after so many years cannot be relied upon.  Though Mr.  Ramachandran, learned senior counsel appearing for the State initially had urged that the evidence of PW3 so far as she identified accused Vijayan in the Court can be accepted even discarding the Test Identification Parade but ultimately could not support the said contention with any authority.  As a matter of prudence it is highly unsafe to accept the identification of accused in Court many years after the occurrence when the Test Identification Parade made shortly after the occurrence has not been accepted.  There are also several other reasons for discarding the evidence of PW3 since according to PW3 the person who gave the bell was not a tall man though height of Vijayan is more than 6 feet.  For a person to just see his face while opening the door and then remember the same for the purpose of identification after five years of occurrence, in our considered opinion is just impossible.  The evidence of PW3 and the circumstances sought to be proved through her evidence by the prosecution cannot be relied upon and the High Court committed gross error in relying upon the same.  The next circumstance sought to be relied upon by the prosecution and accepted by the High Court is through the evidence of PW 9 who on the date of occurrence was returning after supplying milk and then he saw accused Vijayan running away without any chappal and in a worried manner.  The High Court relied upon his evidence essentially on the ground that he saw accused being clad with a blue pant and shirt and was running without any footwear.  We have gone through the evidence of PW It is indeed difficult for us to rely upon his evidence and it is highly improbable for a man to remember any person running on the street without chappal.  That apart his so called identification in the Test Identification Parade was rightly dis-believed by the Sessions Judge in as much as by the date the Test Identification Parade was conducted not only the photograph of the accused had been shown to PW3 and in all probability must have been shown to Pw9 but also in all the local newspapers the photograph had already been printed.  In such circumstances the Sessions Judge in our view, rightly came to the conclusion that the Test Identification Parade is nothing but a farce and cannot be relied upon.  The High Court on the other hand appears to have been persuaded by the fact that since a man was found to be running during an early hours without chappal on his foot and with blue pant and blue shirt it was possible for PW9 to identify him.  With respect we would say the reasonings of the learned Judges of the High Court are totally unsustainable and having gone through the evidence of PW9 we have no hesitation to come to a conclusion that his evidence cannot be relied upon by the prosecution.  Another circumstance sought to be established through the evidence of PW 4, a young girl living a few yards away from the house of deceased.  According to her she heard the sound of somebody running and when she turned she saw accused Vijayan running away after crossing a water channel and was wearing a blue pant and blue shirt.  It is no doubt true that she identified accused Vijayan in the Test Identification Parade but for the reasons already advanced while discussing the evidence of PWs 3 & 9 identification of accused in Test Identification Parade cannot be relied upon.  The High Court unfortunately appears to have taken a view that the identification of accused by PW4 in the Test Identification Parade should be relied upon.  We are unable to agree with this conclusion particularly when it is apparent from the prosecution material that much before the holding of Test Identification Parade photograph of the accused Vijayan had been published in the newspaper and because of certain sensation in the locality it had lot of publicity and there was sufficient opportunity for the witnesses being shown the accused person.  In this view of the matter in our considered opinion the High Court erroneously interfered with the conclusion of the learned Session Judge in this regard and came to hold that the identification of Vijayan by PW4 in great detail and we are unable to subscribe the view the High Court has taken on the evidence of the aforesaid witnesections We also really fail to understand how a witness seeing an unknown man running away could be able to identify him at a later point of time.  No special feature was also indicated by the witnesections In our view the evidence of PW4 is totally unworthy of credit and as such, cannot be relied upon for bringing home the charge.  PW 7 was the person who saw the accused boarding auto rickshaw which was driven by PW Though PW7 also had identified accused in the Test Identification Parade which had been conducted by the Magistrate PW61 but in the Court he could not identify the accused and, therefore, the so called identification in Test Identification Parade loses its importance.  That apart the reasons for vitiating the Test Identification parade already indicated would apply so far as the identification by PW7 in the T.I.  Parade is concerned.  In this view of the matter we are of the considered opinion that the High Court erroneously relied upon the so called identification of Vijayan by PW7 in the TI Parade even though in Court he did not identify Vijayan.  The auto rickshaw driver PW2 stated in his evidence that he took the accused in autorikshaw from Ideal Lodge to Veekshanam office.  According to him he had taken accused Vijayan during that morning and second accused came there through the cross road and he also travelled in his authorikshaw and then alighted from the vehicle.  His evidence has been relied upon by the High Court to bring home the charge of conspiracy under Section 120 B Indian Penal Code, 1860.  It may be seen that he was examined by the police on 1982 roughly one year after the occurrence.  It has been elicited from him that he was compelled to say that both the accused travelled in his vehicle by the police.  Prosecution re- examined him and brought out from him on re-examination that one Joseph had approached him and paid him rs.500/- for making such statement in the Court.  We have examined the evidence of PW2 and in our opinion he must be held to be an unreliable witness and no part of his evidence could be relied upon.", "statute": ["s3", "s2"]}, "1996.INSC.1283.txt": {"doc_url": "http://www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/1996/1283/.html", "explanation": {"On proceeding further they saw the two Lunas which overtook them were parked on the road facing Yavatmal and one person who was lying on the ground at the end of the road, was Udey Shankar dixit and the appellant was assaulting him with knife.": ["s3"], "Shainesh Chandra (PW 8) who held the autopsy over the dead body testified that Ramesh Patil (since deceased) had sustained as many as 37 incised ante mortem injuries of which not less than ten were on vital parts of the body and that those injuries were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.": ["s3"]}, "fact": " THE STATE OF MAHARASHTRA [1996] INSC 1283 (9 October 1996) M.K.  MUKHERJEE, sectionP.  KURDUKAR ACT: HEADNOTE: sectionP.  KURDUKAR, J.  The appellant-original accused no.2 alongwith six other accused persons was tried in Sessions Case Trial no.  45 of 1984 for having committed the murder of one Ramesh Haribhau Himane popularly known as \"Ramesh Patil\" resident of village Bhari Distt.  Yavatmal in the evening of January 6, The appellant and original accused Nos.  1,3 and 4 were charged under Section 302/34 of the Indian Indian Penal Code, 1860, 1860 whereas remaining three accused persons were charged for offences punishable under Sections 201,202 and 212 of the Indian Indian Penal Code, 1860, 1860.  Udey Shankar Dixit-original accused no.1, however, was murdered during the pendency of the trial hence it abated against him.  The trial court by its judgment and order dated 8th July, 1986, acquitted all the accused persons except the appellant who was convicted under Section 302/34 of the Indian Indian Penal Code, 1860, 1860, and sentenced him to suffer imprisonment for life and to pay a fine of rs.1,000/-.  The appellant's appeal to the High Court of Bombay, Bench at Nagpur, came to be dismissed on 13-2- It is against this judgment and order of High Court, the appellant on obtaining special leave had filed this appeal.  2.  The facts of the prosecution case lie in a very narrow compass:- Ramesh Patil (since deceased) was allotted 15 acres of land in village Bhari situated at a distance of about 6 kms.  from Yavatmal on Yavatmal-Pandhar Kowada road and was doing cultivation.  Haribhau (PW 2) is the father of Ramesh Patil who was then residing in his own house at Yavatmal.  Ramesh Patil used to go to Village Bhari everyday at about 00 a.m.  and would return at about 30 p.m.  3.  It is alleged by the prosecution that in the year 1978, Ramesh Patil alongwith six other persons of whom some are prosecution witnesses in the present case, was prosecuted under Section 307 of the Indian Indian Penal Code, 1860, 1860 for having attempted to commit the murder of Udey Shankar Dixit (A-1).  However, on the conclusion of the said trial, Ramesh Patil and other accused persons were acquitted.  Since then, the two rival groups were on inimical terms and, therefore.  Ramesh Patil apprehended danger to his life from Udey Shankar Dixit and the appellant.  4.  It was then alleged by the prosecution that on January 6, 1984, Ramesh Patil as usual was returning on his bicycle to Yavatmal at about 00 p.m.  by Yavatmal-pandhar-Kawada road.  Arvind Mangruikar (PW 6) and Dadarao Thakre (PW 7) resident of village Bhari had then come to Yavatmmal at about 00 p.m.  to watch a matinee show in Sham Talkies.  After the matinee show, they were going back to their village Bhari double seat on a bicycle of Arvind Mangrulkar (PW 6).  When they came near the octroi post, two lunas coming from behind over took them.  Udey Shankar Dixit was driving the Luna of blue colour and A-3 was the Pillion rider.  The appellant was riding on another Luna of brown colour and A-4 was the pillion rider.  Both these lunas went in the direction of village Bhari.  Arvind Mangrulkar (PW 6) and Dadarao Thakre (PW 7) stopped near the bridge for answering nature's call and when they crossed the bridge, heard the shrieks \"bachao-bachao\" coming from the opposite direction.  On proceeding further they saw the two Lunas which overtook them were parked on the road facing Yavatmal and one person who was lying on the ground at the end of the road, was Udey Shankar dixit and the appellant was assaulting him with knife.  Anil and Suresh were standing nearby.  after seeing the incident for about a minute or so.  arvind Mangrulkar (PW 6) and Dadarao Thakre (PW 7) proceeded to their village Bhari and there they came to know from the villagers that the person who was assaulted on Yavatmal- Pandhar Kawada road was, Ramesh Patil.  5.  Suresh (PW 1) who returned at about 30 p.m.  from the village Waihatola learnt from Kashinath (PW 4) that Ramesh Patil was murdered and his body was lying in front of Malani Park.  one kilometer away from Yavatmal.  He then went to the spot where he met Partap Paraskar (PW 19).  After seeing the dead body of Ramesh Patil, both of them went to Yavatmal City Police Station where Suresh (PW 1) lodged a written report exhibit 34 at about 55 p.m.  The SHO registered the crime under Section 302 Indian Penal Code, 1860; recorded the formal FIR exhibit200 and proceeded towards the place of incident for investigation.  the inquest panchanama was held on the dead body of Ramesh Patil and it was sent to the Civil Hospital for post mortem examination.  During the investigation, the appellant was arrested on January 8, The statements of Arvind Mangrulkar (PW 6) and Dadarao Thakre (PW 7) were recorded on January 8, The appellant was placed in a test identification parade arranged by the Executive Magistrate on 21st January, 1984 wherein Arvind Mangrulkar (PW 6) identified the appellant.  During the course of investigation, the appellant made a statement under Section 27 of the Evidence Act which led to the recovery of a knife.  After completing the necessary investigation, the appellant alongwith seven other accused persons was put up for trial.  6.  The appellant denied the charge levelled against him and claimed to be tried.  According to him, he was falsely implicated in the present crime due to enmity.  He denied that he was identified by the alleged eye witnesses during the T.  I.  parade.  He is innocent and he be acquitted.  7.  The prosecution in support of its case examined as many as forty witnesses, of whom, Arvind Mangrulkar (PW 6) and Dadarao Thakre (PW 7) were witnesses of fact.  In addition to the above evidence.  the prosecution has relied upon several other circumstances to which reference will be made at the appropriate places.  8.  At the outset, it may be stated that both the courts below accepted the evidence of Arvind Mangrulkar (PW 6) and Dadarao Thakre (PW 7) as trustworthy and credible who gave an eye account of the assault caused on Ramesh Patil.  9.  At the outset, lit may also be stated that there is no challenge to the fact that Ramesh Patil died an unnatural death due to several injuries sustained by him in an incident which took place on January 6, 1984, at about 30 p.m.  Suffice it to mention that Dr.  Shainesh Chandra (PW 8) who held the autopsy over the dead body testified that Ramesh Patil (since deceased) had sustained as many as 37 incised ante mortem injuries of which not less than ten were on vital parts of the body and that those injuries were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.  We feel no hesitation in holding that Ramesh Patil died a homicidal death.  10.  Entire prosecution story to prove the complicity of the appellant, hinges upon the two star witnesses of fact i.e.  arvind Mangrulkar (PW 6) and Dadarao Thakre (PW 7).  Mr.  U.R.  Lalit, Learned Senior Counsel appearing for the appellant while assailing the evidence of these two eye witnesses urged that their testimonies were totally incredible and no reliance whatsoever could be placed on their evidence.  While supplementing this argument, he urged that they were partisan witnesses having hostile relations with the appellant.  He urged that although both these witnesses claimed to have witnessed the assault caused on Ramesh Patil yet they did not disclose the same to anyone to anyone till 8th of January, their silence was totally opposed to the human conduct and in the facts and circumstances of the case, it would be unsafe to rely upon their evidence.  We see on substance whatsoever in any of these submissions.  It is true that the statements of both these witnesses under Section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure were recorded on 8th January, 1984, although, the First Information Report was lodged on 6th January, 1984 at about 55 p.m.  within the shortest possible time.  Both these witnesses in their evidence on oath had stated that they were scared of the appellant and his associates who had identified them at the time of incident.  They further stated that the appellant and his associates were arch rivals of Ramesh Patil and his associates who were the members of Hanuman Vyayam shala.  They admitted that after reaching their village Bhari, they quietly went to their respective houses and did not disclose the fact of assault caused on Ramesh Patil to anybody.  They further admitted although they attended the funeral and were in the company of berieved members of the family yet did not disclose the fact of assault by the appellant on Ramesh Patil to anybody.  They then stated that only when the appellant came to be arrested on 8th January, 1984, they came forward for recording their statements under Section 161 of the code of Criminal Procedure.  Both the courts below have considered these circumstances very carefully and concurrently held that the apprehension expressed by both these witnesses could not be said to be untrue.  This being a finding of fact, it would not be possible for us to interfere with the said finding in an appeal filed under Section 136 of the constitution and it is not possible to discredit their evidence.  10.  It was then urged by Mr.  Lalit that there was enormous delay in lodging the First Information Report.  This submission is again devoid of any merit because the incident in question took place at about 30 p.m.and after getting the information, Suresh (PW 1), the cousin of Ramesh Patil lodged a complaint with the city police station Yavatmal at 55 p.m.  (Ex.200).  Till the lodging of this complaint, there was no clue as regards the assailants and obviously their names could not figure therein.  It is only during the course of investigation, when the appellant came to be arrested on 8th January, 1984, Arvind Mangrulkar (PW 6) and Dadarao Thakre (PW 7) came forward to give the eye account of the assault caused on Ramesh Patil and their statements under Section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure came to be recorded on the same day.  In our opinion, there is no delay whatsoever in lodging the First Information Report.  11.  Mr.  Lalit then urged that the panch witnesses examined by the prosecution were from the stock of Hanuman Vyayam Shala and no independent panch witness was called for by the investigating officer.  Taking support from this fact, Mr.  Lalit urged that the entire investigation was not at all fair and the investigating machinery took the side of the complainant party .  Learned Counsel, therefore, urged that the evidence collected by investigating officer was of partisan witnesses and it would be unsafe to accept such tainted evidence.  Both the courts below were very much aware of the fact that the eye witnesses examined by the prosecution were from the village Bhari and friends of Ramesh Patil yet after careful scrutiny of their evidence accepted the same as credible and did not suffer from any infirmity.  By way of abundant precaution, we have also gone through the evidence of both these eye witnesses and record our complete agreement with the appreciation of their evidence done by the courts below.  Despite strenuous efforts, Mr.  Lalit was unable to point out to us how the investigation was tained one.  It is, therefore, not possible to hold that the investigation was tainted one.  12.", "statute": ["s3"]}, "2013.INSC.354.txt": {"doc_url": "http://www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/2013/354/.html", "explanation": {"In a span of about two hours i.e.  , between 13:33 to 15:40 hours, a series of 12 bomb explosions took place one after the other at the following twelve places in Bombay, namely, Bombay Stock Exchange, Katha Bazaar, Sena Bhavan, Century Bazaar, Mahim Causeway, Air India Building, Zaveri Bazaar, Hotel Sea Rock, Plaza Theatre, Juhu Centaur Hotel, Air Port Bay-54 and Air Port Centaur Hotel.

They first tried to achieve their object by resorting to black magic.  Those attempts, however, remained ineffective.  In May, 1980 A-1 had gone to Maharani Textiles for getting cloth for a safari suit for her son.  When the salesman was bout to cut the costly cloth selected by her, Tomy told him not to give it but to give a cheaper variety.  As a result of this incident A-1 felt humiliated and returned without taking any cloth.  A-1, A-2 and Johny (A-3), whose mother was the maid servant of A-1 and who was also often rendering services to her, decided to do away with Tomy and his family members.  First attempt was made on 1980 when A-1 and A-3 had gone with an insecticide `Dalf' of the house to Tomy but it failed.  Thomas (A-4) had also by that time come in contact with A- He also joined the conspiracy to kill Tomy and the members of his family on being promised a payment of rupees on lakh.  Pursuant to that conspiracy A-4 procured insecticides known as Parataph & Eccalex and the second attempt was made on administer the mixture of those two insecticides after using Chloroform and making Merli and children unconscious.  That attempt failed as Josephine (PW-26) was found present in Merlis house A-1, A-2 and A-4 then made a final decision to use cyanide which is a more powerful poison.  A-4 was able to procure some cyanide from one Chinnappan (PW-27).  As preplanned, on 1980 at about [7 P.M.  A-1](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=7%20PM%20A%2d1) first went to Tomy's house and started talking with her.  After sometime A- 3 and A-4 went there with a pretext that they wanted to see A- A-4 requested Merli go get some water for him to drink.  While she was bringing water A-3 and A-4 caught her from behind, applied pressure on her neck, made her open her mouth and then forcibly put cyanide in her mouth.  She tried to resist that attempt by giving a bite on the hand of A-3 but she was not successful.  The poison had its effect and Merli died immediately.  Then, A-1 with the help of A-3 forcibly gave cyanide to Merli's two children.  They also died instantaneously.  Ammini then left the house after removing a gold chain of Merli from a cupboard.  The other two accused, namely A-3 and A-4 remained behind waiting for Tomy to come; but as he did not come at the expected time they also left.  When Tomy came and saw what had happened he screamed and that brought the neighbours there.  Soon the Police was informed about the incident.  All the accused were then charge-sheeted and tried for the offences punishable under Section 120-B and Section 201, 302, 452 all read with Sections 34, 109 and 11 Indian Penal Code, 1860.  A-2 was separately charged for the offence punishable under Section 411 Indian Penal Code, 1860.  There being no eye witness the prosecution relied upon the following circumstances to prove its case:- (1) A-1 had sufficient motive to exterminate Tomy and his family.  (2) A-1 along with A-2, who was the neighbour of A-1 and with whom she had developed illicit intimacy, first tried to ruin the family of Tomy with the aid of persons practising black magic and witch-craft.  (3) First attempt by A-1, A-2 and A-3 to administer insecticide to merli and her children on (4) Second attempt by A-1, A-2 and A-3 to administer a stronger insecticide to Merli and her children on (5) A-4 jointed the conspiracy and procured cyanide from a goldsmith through PW- (6) Testing of effectiveness of that cyanide by A-1 and A-3 on a cat, which died and whose body was buried by A-3 in the compound of A- (7) A-1 seen going to the house of Tomy on 1980 at about 30 P.M.  and falsely telling persons, whom she met on the way, that she was going to Tharakan's Hospital.  (8) A-3 and A-4 were also seen following A-1 and going towards the house of Tomy.  (9) A-1 was seen coming out of the house at about 30 P.M.  (10) A-3 and A-4 were seen together near the place of occurrence at about 30 P.M.  and thereafter at another place not far away.  A-2 was also seen near that place at about 00 P.M.  (11) A-3 and A-4's disclosure to the doctor who examined them as to how they had received injuries on their hands.  (12) Discovery by A-2 of a gold chain belonging to the deceased.  (13) Recovery of empty bottles of parataph and eccalex on the information given by A- (14) Discovery by A-2 of a mixture of insecticide purchased earlier for killing the deceased.  (15) Discovery by A-4 of a bottle containing cyanide.  Besides the above circumstances the prosecution also relied upon the confession made by A-4 before the judicial Magistrate and the medical evidence, which proved that the deaths were the result of poisoning by cyanide.  The Trial Court held that Merli and her children had died as a result of cyanide poisoning sometime between 30 p.m.  and 9 p.m.  on It ruled out the possibility of Merli and her sons' having committed suicide by taking poison.  But it did not believe the prosecution evidence regarding involvement of the accused and also the confession made by A- It, therefore, acquitted the accused.  We are not stating here the reasons given by the trial court for disbelieving the prosecution evidence as we will be referring to them a little later.  The State challenged the acquittal before the High Court.  The High Court found that most of the reasons given by the trial court for rejecting the prosecution evidence were grossly unreasonable and some of them were almost perverse.  After re-appreciating the evidence it came to a different conclusion as regards the guilt of the accused.  The High Court accepted the evidence of Tomy (PW-2) and his elder brother Paul (PW-15) and held that A-1 was on inimical terms with Tomy and his wife and that she had sufficient motive to finish Tomy and his family members.  The trial Court had also accepted that evidence and held that A- 1 had strong ill- feeling against PW-2 and his wife, Merli.  The High Court also agreed with t he finding of the trial Court that Merli and her children had died as a result of cyanide poisoning sometime between 30 p.m.  and 00 p.m.  on 1980 and that it was not a case of suicide but cyanide was administered to them by an external agency.  The High Court also confirmed the finding recorded by the trial Court relying upon the evidence of PWs 41, 43, 44 and M.Os.  27.  28, 40 and 41, that A-1 and A-2 had resorted to black magic and witch craft for ruining Tomy and his family.  The High Court believing the evidence of PWs 2, 15, 17, 40 and 41 confirmed the finding that Ellyamma, mother of A-3 was employed by A-1 as a maid-servant and that A-3 was also occasionally rendering services to her.  The High Court believed the evidence of PWs 15 and 16 from whose shops A-3 had purchased insecticide `Dalft' on 1980 as they were found to be independent witnesses because they had no reason either to oblige Tomy or the prosecution or to depose falsely against A- The trial Court had rejected their evidence.  PW-15 was disbelieved on the ground that he had not issued a bill and the explanation given by him that he allowed A-3 to go away without taking a bill as he was acquainted with him, was not believable.  The trial Court rejected the evidence of PW-16 on the ground that the copy of the bill produced by him appears to have been prepared subsequently.  Moreover, `Dalf' was neither used by nor recovered from any of the accused.  It as been submitted by the learned counsel for the appellants that the reasons given by the trial court for rejecting the evidence of these witnesss were quite proper and, therefore, the High Court should not have reverse the findings.  In our opinion the reasons given by the trial court were not at all proper.  The evidence of PW-15 could not have been discarded merely because the name of A-3 was not mentioned in the bill and that PW-95, the Investigating Officer, had not made further enquiries with respect to that bill.  What the trial court failed to appreciate was that there was no requirement of mentioning name of the purchaser of the insecticide `dalf' and that there was no reason for the Investigating Officer to make further enquiries with respect to the said bill.  The trial court had held that the bill prepared by PW-16 appears to have been prepared subsequently because in the 2 earlier bills the date mentioned was The trial court failed to appreciate that this witness was approached by the police on 1980 for his statement.  The bill was already in existence then.  It was, nobody's case that it was prepared on or after As regards the first attempt made on the evening of 1980 by him and A-1 to administer that insecticide to Merli and her children, the prosecution had examined PW-38 who was an employee in one of the shops to Tomy and was sent by Tomy to his house for some work.  He deposed that when he reached there at about 15 p.m.  he saw one slim lady and one black that fat chap sitting in the house.  He was told by Merli that the lady was her sister- in- law and the other person was Johny (A-3).  The evidence of this witness was not believed by the trial on the ground that he did not identify A-1 and A-3 in the court as the persons who were seen by him sitting in Tomy's house though he had identified them at the test identification parade held for that purpose.  The High Court accepted the evidence of PW-38 as there was nothing in his cross examination which could have created any doubt regarding truthfulness of his version.  Merely because he did not specifically identify A-3 in the court his evidence could not have been rejected.  It was not that he was asked it identify A-3 in the court and he failed to identify him.  Moreover, even the defence had proceeded on the basis that A-3 was identified in the court as pointed out by the High Court.  Nothing substantial could be urged by the learned counsel for the appellant to disbelieve the evidence of this witnesections The trial reluctantly accepted the evidence of PWs 20 and 21, as they were independent witnesses and nothing could be alleged against them by the defence.  It, therefore, held that their evidence established that A-4 had purchased one bottle of parataph and one bottle of eccalex on 1980 from the shop of PW- It, however, held that \"this circumstance did not constitute an incriminating circumstance because as deposed by these witnesses, he had come to their shop earlier and purchased insecticides.  Another reason given by the trial court for taking that view was that there is no evidence adduced to show that parataph and eccalex purchased by A-4 were used by him or any other accused for commission of this offence\".  The High Court disagreed with this view and observed that the trial court had failed to appreciate that this circumstance was relied upon as a lin in the chain and to prove the preparations that were jointly made by the accused.  In our opinion, the High Court rightly held that its importance and effect were required to be considered along with other circumstances, including the false denial by A- As regards the incident of 1980 the prosecution had relied upon the evidence of Josephine PW-26, sister of Tomy.  According to her she had come to Alwaye from Madras on 1980 as she had some work.  In the evening when she and Merli were at home, A-1 had come there.  Seeing her there A-1 was surprised.  Soon after entering the house she had made a telephone call to someone.  She left the house after about 15 minutes.  When she and Merli had stepped out of the house to see off A-1 she had seen two person near the gate.  One of them uttered the name of Merli as if he was an acquaintance.  Merli had then informed her that he was Johny (A-3).  the trial court did not believe PW-26 for the reason that her version was artificial and that had not identified A-3 in the court as the person whom she had seen on that day though she had identified him at the identification parade.  The trial court did not attach any importance to the identification of A-3 at the test identification parade as it found that it was not satisfactorily held and also because by that time photographs of all the accused were published in newspapers.  To prove this incident of 1980 and involvement of A-3 and A-4 the prosecution had also relied upon the recovery of MOs, 31, 32 and [44.  MOs 31 ](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=44%20MOs%2031) and 32, being bottles of parataph and eccalex, were recovered at the instance of A-3 from the courtyard of house of A-3 on the trial court did not attach any importance to it on the ground that it was not established that they were the same bottles as were purchased by A-4 from the shop of PW-20 on MO 44 was recovered at the instance of A- 2.  It was whisky bottle and it contained mixture of Parataph and eccalex as stated in the certificate issued by the Joint Director of the Forensic Science Laboratory.  The trial court rejected this evidence as the bottle was recovered from an open space accessible to all and that even though only 100 Ml.  Of parataph and 100 ml.  Of eccalex were purchased, the mixture that was recovered from the bottle was 220 mls.  The trial court also held that the prosecution had failed to establish that the said bottle contained mixture of parataph and eccalex as the certificate was signed by the Joint Director of Forensic Science Laboratory, and not by the Director and, therefore, it was not admissible under Section 293(4) of the Cr.  P.C.  The High Court after referring to the cross-examination of PWs 26 and 38 held that even the defence had proceeded on the basis that the accused were correctly identified in the court also, and, therefore, the sessions court was wrong in discarding their evidence.  As regards the recovery of MOs 31 and 32, the High Court held that PW-20 had correctly identified those bottles by the caps of those bottles.  The High Court further held that though MO 44 was recovered from an open space, i.e.  , from the gutter nearby the office of A- 2, but as it was proved that it contained mixture of parataph and eccalex, this recovery evidence deserved to be believed.  The sessions court was of the view that these circumstances even if believed were not incriminating circumstances.  The High Court was of the view that these circumstances, namely, purchasing of parataph and eccalex by A-3, recovery of empty bottles from the courtyard of the house of A-1 at the instance of A-4 and recovery of MO 44 containing mixture of parataph and eccalex at the instance of A-2, did indicate a joint attempt by the four accused.  The learned counsel for the appellants could not seriously challenge of Josephine (PW-26) but submitted that the evidence regarding recovery of MOs, 31, 32 and 44 should not have been accepted by the High Court.  It is true that MOs 31 and 32 did not have any label on them but PW-20 was able to identify them by their caps being familiar with them.  The High Court was, therefore, right in holding that the prosecution was able to establish that the bottles which were discovered by A-3 from the court-yard of the house of A-1 were the bottles of parataph and eccalex.  A-3's knowledge about the concealment of those bottles was not innocent.  When facts, which have a bearing on the guilt of the accused, are established, yet denied by the accused they assume importance.  This aspect was totally missed by the trial court.  similarly, MO 44, though recovered from a place accessible to all, was found from under the water and was thus not visible to all.  It was A-2, who had taken it out of water.  Moreover the contents of the bottle turned out to be the mixture of parataph and eccalex as stated by A- The statement made by A-2 before recovering the bottle thus stood corroborated.  The trial court was also wrong in holding with respect to the contents of MO-44 was not admissible in evidence as it was signed by its Joint Director and not by the Director.  On true construction of Section 293 (4) Cr.  P.C.  it has to be held that Joint Director is comprehended by the expression `Director'.  The amendment made in clause (e) of Section 293(4) now indicates that clearly.  If the Joint Director was not comprehended within the expression Director then the Legislature would have certainly named him while amending the clause and providing that Section 293 applied to the Deputy Director or Assistant Director of a Central Forensic Science Laboratory or a State Forensic Science Laboratory.  A Joint Director is a higher officer than a Deputy Director or an Assistant Director and, therefore, it would be unreasonable to hold that a report signed by Joint Director is not admissible in evidence though a report signed by Deputy Director or Assistant Director is now admissible.  In our opinion the High Court was right in holding that the report made by the Joint Director was admissible in evidence and that it deserved to be relied upon.  To prove that A-4 had procured potassium cyanide the prosecution had examined Chinnappan (PW-27).  This witness has stated that about a couple of weeks prior to the death of Merli and her children, while he was waling along with A- 4 on a road, A-4 had told him that he was in need of some effective poison to kill stray dogs which were destroying his poultry.  He was first hesitant to give potassium cyanide to A-4 but on further persuasion he gave a small quantity of it in a bottle of Vicks.  The prosecution had also examined PW-23, who was working with PW-27 in the same jewellery shop to establish that about 4 or 5 days before the death of Merli and her children he had seen PW-27 and A- 4 together discussing something secretly.  The prosecution had also examined PW-24 to prove that A-4 was seen in the house of PW-27 a few days before the death of Merli.  The evidence of PW-27 was disbelieved by the sessions court on the ground that he did not have a licence to possess cyanide and the Investigating Officer had not made any attempt to find out the source.  The High Court held that these reasons were not at all sufficient for discarding his evidence.  PW-27 was working in a jewellery shop and the shop owner did have a licence to posses potassium cyanide.  Moreover, PW-27 had stated that he had obtained it from one Narayanan, another goldsmith and the Investigating Office could not question him as he had died before he could have been questioned by the Investigating Officer.  One more reason was given by the trial court for disbelieving the evidence of PW-27 was that he had not disclosed the fact of giving potassium cyanide to A-4 to any other person.  The High Court observed that this was not at all a good ground for rejecting his evidence.  In our opinion, the High Court was right in observing that this important piece of evidence was very lightly brushed aside by the trial court on flimsy ground.  The circumstance under which PW-27 had obtained potassium cyanide and given it to A-4 was such that he would not have liked to disclose that fact to anyone.  As rightly pointed out by the High Court PW-27 being a goldsmith, it was quite likely that he was able to obtain potassium cyanide even though he did not have a licence to possess it, as cyanide is commonly used used by goldsmith for electroplating gold ornaments.  In order to prove that Merli and her children were alive till 00 p.m.  the prosecution had examined PW-32, a boy aged 14 years, who had gone to Tomy's house to give a packet of surf at 00 p.m.  The evidence of this witness was not at all challenged.  The trial court did not record any finding with respect to his evidence.  The High Court accepted it and held that till 00 p.m.  on 1980, Merli and her children were alive.  The prosecution had also led evidence to prove the movements of A-1, A-3 and A-4 between 30 p.m.  and 00 p.m.  on that day.  Ennamma (PW-3), who was residing just opposite to A-1's house, stated that she had seen A-1' coming out of her house at about 30 p.m.  and proceeding towards the house of Tomy.  She further stated that her attention was drawn towards A-1 because it was unusual for A-1 to move out of her house at such a late hour.  She has also stated that a few minutes later she had seen A-3 and A- 4 coming out of the house A-1 and going towards Tomy's house.  The trial court did not disbelieve the evidence of this witness but held that what she had stated did not amount to an incriminating circumstance and therefore, no weight could be attached to it.  Only omission brought out in her cross-examination was that she had not give the name of A-4 in her police statement but had described i as \"Duck Youngster\".  The High Court held that her evidence deserved to be believed and it did establish that A-1, and A-3 and A- 4 were see together near the house of A-1 about and hour before the incident.  PW-4 had met A-1 sometime thereafter on the road and inquired from her as to where she was going.  A- 1 had told her that she was going to Tharakan's Hospital the prosecution had examined Rosy (PW-11), mother of Raju.  She categorically stated that A-1 had not come to see Raju and she had not noticed her in the hospital.  Her evidence was discarded by the trial court on the ground that it was quite likely that she might not have remained present near Raju all the time and therefore, might not have noticed A- The prosecution had also examined PW-47 whose two children were also admitted in the hospital.  He has stated that his relations with A-2 were quite intimate and, therefore if she had come to the hospital she would not have gone away without meeting him and enquiring about the health of his two sons.  He was present in the hospital from 00 p.m.  to 00 p.m.  on that day and, therefore, he would have certainly noticed the presence of A- the evidence of this witness was not disbelieved by the trial court but it held that it did not falsify the explanation of A-1 that she had in fact gone to the hospital to see Raju.  The High Court held that this was not a reasonable view and the trial court ought to have appreciated that the explanation given by A-1 was false and thus this wan an incriminatory circumstance.  We are also of the view that the trial court had completely misunderstood the significance of the evidence of PWs-11 and 47.  The evidence discloses that Raju was serious.  Therefore, his mother was bounded to be by his side.  It was, therefore, not likely that when A-1 had gone to see Raju, his mother was not by his side and, therefore, she had not noticed the presence of A-1 in the hospital.  It was equally unlikely that if A-1 had really gone to the hospital, she would have returned without meeting PW-47 and inquiring about the health of his two sons.  The reason given by the trial court for holding that the evidence of PWs-11 and 47 did not falsify the explanation of A-1 was thus not sustainable.  the High Court was, therefore, right in placing reliance upon the evidence of these two witness and holding that the explanation given by A-1 was false.  The movements of A-1, A-3 and A-4 between 00 p.m.  and 30 p.m.  were also noticed by other witnessections Evidence of some of them was not disbelieved by the trial court.  Evidence of others was discarded on flimsy grounds as pointed out by the High Court.  We do not think it necessary to refer to the evidence of all those witnesses and it would be sufficient to state that the said evidence was rightly believed by the High Court.  We will only refer to the evidence of Joseph (PW-8) who was, at that time, serving as an officer in the Life Insurance Corporation.  He has deposed that at about 35 p.m.  , while he was passing by the house of Tomy, he had sen one woman coming out of his house.  He first thought that she was Merli and, therefore, looked at her to have a talk with her.  He at once noticed that she was not Merli so without talking with her he proceeded further after passing by her side.  He has further stated that on the next day he had visited Tomy's house to attend the funeral and at that time, inside the room where the dead bodies were laid, he had seen in the woman, whom he had seen on the previous night.  He therefore, enquired from Paul Dominic (PW-46) and PW-27 as to who she was and they had told him that she was Ammini, widow of Francis.  He informed both of them that he had seen her coming out of Tomy's house on the previous evening.  This revelation by him had raised a flutter among the mourners and it had finally Tomy.  Tomy has stated that he had informed his brother Paul (PW-50) that he had come to know that A-1 had visited his house at about 30 p.m.  on the day of the incident.  PW-50 has stated that he had asked Ammini about her said visit but she had flatly denied it.  The trial court disbelieved the evidence of this independent witness PW- One reason given was that while Tomy informed his brother Paul that Lucy, Sheela and two boys had see A-1 going and coming out of his house he had not mentioned the name of PW-8 as one of the persons who had also informed him about A-1's visit.  The High Court has strongly criticised the learned Sessions Judge for discarding the evidence of this witnesections It pointed out that PW-8 had not stated that he had told Tomy that he had seen Ammini waling near about his house at the time of incident.  Therefore, while informing his brother he had only generally stated that Lucy Sheela and two boys had told him about that.  Since he was not directly informed by PW-8 it is likely that he had either thought it not fit or in view of his mental condition, had forgotten to mention the name of PW- Another ground given by the trial court for rejecting his evidence was that the woman seen by him was wearing spectacles but A-1 was not seen wearing spectacles during the whole trial and that no attempt was made by the Investigating Officer to trace the spectacles of A- The High Court held that these reasons were perverse.  It observed that it was absolutely unnecessary for the Investigating Officer to search for her spectacles.  Moreover, the evidence of PW-46, PW-47 and PW-50 the eldest brother-in-law of A-1 proved that A-1 was often wearing spectacles.  The High Court after considering the reasons for rejecting the evidence of PW-8 by the trial court observed: \"Sessions Judge was groping for some reason to reject the valuable testimony of PW-8, and when he failed to trace out any good reason, he traversed through preposterous ideas for rejecting his testimony\".  On re-appreciation of his evidence the High Court found that it had a ring of truth in it and it established beyond and doubt that A-1 was seen coming out of the house of Tomy at about 45 p.m.  We may also refer to the evidence of Aliamma (PW-15) who has stated that at about 30 p.m.  while she and one Kunjamma were returning from the hospital and were passing by the house to Tomy they had a cry of a child coming from the house to Tomy.  As no further cry was heard and it was drizzling they did not stop and proceeded further.  This witness was not at all cross-examined by the defence.  Her evidence was not disbelieved by the trial court but no importance was attached to it.  The High Court rightly considered this as a relevant circumstance as it proved that at about 30 p.m.  something had happened in the house of Tomy which had made a child cry loudly.  The High Court held that the evidence of this witness together with the other evidence regarding movements of the accused and the evidence of PW-8 established that A-1 had gone to the House of Tomy some time after 00 p.m.  , that Merli and her children were killed at about 30 p.m.  and that A-1 was found leaving that house at about 35 p.m.  As regards the subsequent movements of the A-1, A-3 and A-4 the prosecution had led the evidence of PWs-25, 28 29 and 30.  Their evidence was also disbelieved by the trial court on flimsy grounds.  The High Court has pointed out how the said reasons can not be considered as proper and sufficient.  In therefore, held that even their evidence deserved to be accepted.  The next circumstances relied upon by the prosecution was that while administering cyanide to Merli, A-3 and A-4 had received injuries.  A-3 was arrested on 1980 and he was taken to Dr.  Abraham (PW-60) for his medical examination.  The doctor had found three injuries on the fingers of his right hand.  When the doctor had asked him how he had received those injuries, he had stated that \"these small injuries were caused by biting when I closed Merli's mouth to silence her at 30 p.m.  on Monday before last\".  This evidence was disbelieved by the trial court on the ground that the certificate issued by the doctor was on plain piece of paper and not on the printed form, that no serial number was mentioned in that certificate and that when finger prints of third accused were taken by the police on 1980 the Investigating Officer had seen only scars of the wound which indicated that the wounds had healed up earlier.  A-4 was arrested on 1980 and when he was taken to Dr.  Vasant Kumari (PW-64) for medical examination.  she had noticed that his two injuries were in the healing procesections On being asked about the injuries A-4 had told her that \"my left elbow and the outer part of the right hand were injuries while taking Merli to the Kitchen, holding her from behind with left hand, inside Merli's house at about 30 p.m.  on Monday, 1980\".  The trial court rejected her evidence on the ground that the certificate issued by her was also on a plain piece of paper and an endorsement made therein was in different ink.  The High Court considered both the grounds as improper and insufficient.  It observed that it was well known then that printed form were in short supply in Government hospitals in the district of Ernakulam.  The certificates were issued by the doctors, who were attached to Government hospitals at Alwaye and Perumbavoor, bot of which were situated in the same district of Ernakulam.  The High Court further found that there was nothing to show that the doctors had any reason to prepare false certificates.  The High Court, therefore, held that the evidence of the doctors and the certificates issued by them were true.  The High Court also held that what A-3 and A-4 told the doctors amounted to an admission.  In fact the trial court had also held that they being admissions were not hit by any provision of the Evidence Act.  Next important circumstance disbelieved by the trial court was the find of finger prints of A-3 on one of the two glasses (MOs 1 and 2) seized from Tomy's house on 1980 under Mahazer (Ex.57).  Finger prints found on those two glasses were compared with the admitted finger prints of A-3 and it was found that the finger prints found on one glass tallied with the finger prints of A- The trial court disbelieved this important evidence on the ground that the earlier photographs of those impressions were not clear enough to enable the expert to come to any definite conclusion and, therefore, it was doubtful whether the subsequent photographs were of the original finger prints.  The trial court took his view as it found that the prosecution had not explained how on the subsequent occasion it was possible for the photographer to redevelop those impressions in a better manner and have better photographs.  The trial court was also of the view that even though the photographs were taken on the second occasion in presence of the Judicial Magistrate, not much value could be given to them as the glasses had remained in the custody of the Investigating Officer and, therefore, there was a possibility of introducing fresh finger prints of A-3 on those glasses.  The trial court also doubted their genuineness on the ground that when photographs were taken the Judicial Magistrate had not taken care to see whether the camera had any lens.  The High Court has severely criticised the trial court for taking such a view and in our opinion rightly.  It was not even suggested by the defence that A-3's finger prints were again taken by the Investigating Officer on those glasses.  The finding of the trial court was, therefore, speculative in nature.  In absence of any effective cross-examination of the photographer his evidence that he was able to take better photographs on the second occasion not have been disbelieved by the trial court.  It was also improper to brush aside this clinching evidence on the ground that the confession of A-4 does not mention that A-3 had again taken water from the glass that was found in the kitchen.  In our opinion, the High Court was right in relying upon this evidence regarding which nothing else could be urged.  That evidence established the presence of A-3 in Tomy's House.  To prove the complicity of A-2 the prosecution had relied upon the recovery of gold chain (MO-9) belonging to the deceased and the bottle (MO-44) containing mixture of parataph and eccalex recovered on the basis of information given by him.  It has been held proved that the gold chain belonged to the deceased.  The trial court, however, held that it was not proved that A-2 had concealed the same in the store room of Sub-Divisional Office of the Telegraph Department, where he was working.  The trial court placing reliance upon the evidence of the officer watchman (PW-88) and the defence witness DW-3 came to the conclusion that the chain appeared to have been planted there by the police.  The trial court also held that the whole story regarding removal of the chain and it being given by A-1 to A-2 and A-2 concealing it in the store room was \"too shedy to be worthy of any judicial credit\".  The High Court on close scrutiny of their evidence found that the watchman and D-3 being the Co- employees had fabricated evidence regarding A-2's leave to help A-2 and had falsely deposed that on 1980 some policemen accompanied by A-2 had approached the watchman and told him to open to store room and after going inside had left it after some time.  The High Court believed the prosecution evidence and held that it has successfully established that the gold chain (MO-8) was concealed by A-2 below a bundle of wire in the store room where he was working and that it was recovered on the basis of the statement made by him before the panch witnesses.  We have already pointed out earlier why the trial court had not believed the recovery of bottle containing mixture of parataph and eccalex and why the High Court has held that the reasons given by the trial court are improper.  The confession made by A-4 before the Judicial Magistrate was discarded by the trial court as it found it to be not voluntary and true.  The reasons given by it for taking view were - (1) while A-4 was remanded to judicial custody by the Judicial Magistrate on 1980 the Magistrate had thought it fit to give a direction that he should not be kept in the sub-jail at Alwaye as the three co-accused were in that sub-jail and this indicated that if he had been allowed to remain the other accused he would not have made the confession.  (2) The confession was retracted soon after A-4 was released on bail.  (3) While retracting the confession and also during his examination under section [313 Cr.  P.C.  A-4](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=313%20Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898%20A%2d4) had stated that he was made to take an oath to make a confession and he was told by the police that if he made a confession he would be protected.  (4) The Judicial Magistrate had not asked him whether he was pressurised by the police to make the confession.  (5) The Judicial Magistrate had started recording the confession soon after A-4 was produced before him on (6) The Judicial Magistrate had not recorded separate reasons, apart from stating so in the memorandum, for believing that A-4 was making the confession voluntarily.  (7) The confession is very long and runs into as many as 20 pages.  (8) A-4 had disowned the first bail application which was made on his behalf after 7th .  According to the trial court all these circumstances indicated that A-4 made the confession while he was in the state of fear and mental collapse and that even after he had made the confession he was under pressure from the police while in custody.  The trial court had held the confession as not true as it found that there were some discrepancies between the confession as recorded by the Judicial Magistrate and what was recorded with respect to it by the Investigating Officer in his case diary.  The following inconsistencies were noted by the trial court:- 1.  In the confession A-4 has stated that the first attempt was made on 1980 where as in the case diary it was mentioned that the first attempt was made initially on 9th and then on 10th.  2.  No reference is made to the chain of Merli in the confession Exh.  P-40 though that fact is referred to in the case diary.  3.  The name of Chinnappan P-27 is not mentioned in Exh.  P- 40 but it is mentioned in the case diary.  4.  Though breaking of a glass in the hand of the Merli is mentioned in the case diary, it is not so stated in the confession.  According to the trial court these omissions indicated that A-4 was forced and tutored to make the confession.  The High Court held that the trial court had looked at the confession with suspicion.  The High Court also held that in comparing the confession with the record of it in the case diary the trial court had committed an illegality and the finding recorded by it, therefore, stood vitiated.  We are of the opinion that the High Court was right in taking this view.  If while remanding A-4 to judicial custody the Judicial Magistrate thought it fit to keep him away from the police and the co-accused, it is difficult to appreciate how such a direction can be regarded as a circumstance indicating that confession was not voluntary.  So also it is difficult to appreciate how from the circumstance that the Judicial Magistrate had started recording the confession within a short time after A-4 was produced before him on 7th an inference could have been drawn that he was not making the confession voluntary.  Merely because A-4 while retracting his confession and during his examination under section 313 Cr.  P.C.  had alleged that he had made the confession under pressure and force from the police, it was not proper for the trial court to conclude that the confession was not voluntarily made.  The trial court ought to have appreciated that the confession was retracted four days after the accused was released on bail.  No such complaint was made by him while he was in judicial custody from 7th till he was released on bail after about a fortnight.  Except the bare allegation there was no material on record to indicate that police had pressurised A-4 or had forced him to make the confession.  The trial court was not justified in considering the length of the confession as a suspicious circumstance.  The confession was a complete record of the steps taken by the Magistrate, the question put to the accused and the answers given by him.  The High Court has also pointed out how other reason given by the trial court are also improper.  While agreeing with the trial court that the Judicial Magistrate had failed to inquire from A-4 as to whether he was promised that he would be made an approver if he made the confession, the High Court held that this omission was of no significance as A-4 was clearly warned that if he made a confession it was likely to be used against him.  The High Court was also right in holding that the trial court in relying extensively on the case diary had committed an illegality.  The omission found by the trial court as a result of that illegal effort were minor and did not justify the conclusion that the confession was not voluntarily made.  In the absence of any requirement that separate reasons were required to be recorded for believing that the confession was made voluntarily it was not proper for the trial court to doubt its genuineness on the ground that the reasons were not recorded separately though the satisfaction was recorded in the memorandum.", "statute": ["s3", "s2"]}, "1998.INSC.107.txt": {"doc_url": "http://www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/1998/107/.html", "explanation": {"Then, all the three dead bodies were dragged to the open land lying behind the Junior High School, put them on the heap of dung cakes and lit fire to them.": ["s2"]}, "fact": " ##  STATE UTTAR PRADESH V.

K. GOPALAKRISHNA [2005] INSC 47 (18 January 2005)  The deceased Veena was the daughter of Laxmamma (PW1) and was married to the respondent on June 3, 1991.  Laxmamma (PW1) is a resident of Shimoga while the respondent at the time of his marriage was a resident of Gundlupet.  A male child was born to the couple on March 7, 1992.  The case of the prosecution is that the respondent out of greed had been pressing his wife (deceased) to get money from her mother so that he could start a business.  There is evidence on record to indicate that the respondent then was employed in a private firm and was looking for better opportunities in life.  Ultimately with the help of one Mr. Umapathy who was then a Special Deputy Commissioner,and who was another son-in- law of PW1, the respondent was able to secure the job of a Lecturer in the Government Pre University College at Nesargi in the district of Belgaum.  On 26th July, 1993 respondent joined as a lecturer in the aforesaid college and started living there.  On or about 25.10.1993 he came to the house of his mother-in-law at Shimoga and took away his wife Veena to Nesargi.  It appears that a sister of the deceased namely Vijaya (PW11) was to get married and the betrothal ceremony was to be held on 25.10.1993 at Bangalore.  In that connection most of the family members had gone to Bangalore but some of them remained at Shimoga to look after the house.  The case of the prosecution is that despite the request made to the respondent, he refused to attend the marriage ceremony of Vijaya (PW11).  Ultimately, the marriage of Vijaya (PW11) took place on 18.11.1993 with PW24 at Bangalore.  Four days thereafter, on 22.11.1993 the occurrence took place in which Veena as well as her child lost their lives.

However, in appeal by the State against this acquittal, the present appellant Govindaraju was convicted for the offence under Section 304B, Indian Penal Code, 1860 and was sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for seven years.  That is how the accused is before us in this appeal.  3.  The prosecution case was that Susheela was married to the present appellant on The original accused Nos.  2 and 3 were parents of the present appellant, while A-4, with whom we are not concerned, was his brother.  Susheela died due to burn injuries in her matrimonial home on the night of 28/29 January, She had no father.  Hence, her matrimonial uncle, Ram Krishan had celebrated her marriage.  After he came to know about the death of Susheela, he filed a complaint at 9:30 a.m.  on 1987 on the basis of which the further investigation was started and the charge-sheet was filed against the four accused persons.  Even before that, A-2, Krishnaiah expired and hence the charges were framed against accused Nos.  1, 3 and 4 for the offence under Section 302, 304B, 201 read with Section 34, Indian Penal Code, 1860.  3 4.  After the charges were framed, A-3 Eramma @ Marimadamma also expired and, therefore, the evidence was recorded only against the appellant/original accused no.1 Govindaraju and his brother A-4, Vasu.  The prosecution case initially was that at the time of marriage the accused had demanded the dowry of rs.5,000/- and even thereafter during the subsistence of marriage he kept on pestering Susheela and her uncle for dowry.  At the time when Susheela expired she was pregnant.  She was treated by her in- laws in a cruel manner and ultimately murdered, or as the case may be, she committed suicide due to the cruel treatment of her in- laws and her husband.  As a result of this, she died barely within a few months of her marriage.  In support of the prosecution case number of witnesses came to be examined including PW-1, her matrimonial uncle, PW-2, her brother, PW-3 another elderly relative and her mother as also some other relations including PW-4 along with other witnesses on investigation and the medical aspect.  5.  Initially, the 1st Additional Sessions Judge, Mysore acquitted all the accused persons which acquittal was challenged before the High Court which set aside the judgment of the Sessions Judge insofar as the present appellant is concerned and convicted him for the offence under Section 304-B.  6.  The Learned Counsel, appearing on behalf of the appellant, vehemently contended that the High Court had erred in upsetting the 4 judgment of acquittal passed by the Trial Court.  In that, the High Court had not found specifically that the findings on acquittal recorded by the Trial Court were in any manner perverse.  He further pointed out that the case of the prosecution was initially to the effect that all the accused persons had committed murder of Susheela and the charge under Section 304-B Indian Penal Code, 1860 was also be framed against the accused persons.  The charge under Section 302 having failed and not having been accepted by the Trial Court, the very basis of the prosecution case was knocked down.  This aspect has not been considered by the High Court.  Further, the Learned Counsel urged that the story that this accused (appellant herein) in particular and all the other accused in general, meted out cruel treatment to deceased Susheela, was a myth, as there is no evidence, whatsoever, to suggest that Susheela was, in any manner, physically tortured or ill- treated.", "statute": ["s3", "s2"]}, "2008.INSC.1302.txt": {"doc_url": "http://www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/2008/1302/.html", "explanation": {"Thereafter A-1 and A-2 took 7 P.W.23 and PW.11 to Guruthippa where they found remains of a skeleton scattered here and there, due to the eating away by some animals.

Petitioner Versus Central Bureau of Investigation & Anr.  Respondents O R D E R 1.  The instant controversy emerges out of a double murder, committed on the night intervening 15- On having found the body of Aarushi Talwar in her bedroom in house no.  L-32, Jalvayu Vihar, Sector 25, Noida, her father Dr.  Rajesh Talwar got a first information report registered at Police Station Sector 20, Noida, on In the first information report Dr.  Rajesh Talwar pointed the needle of suspicion at Hemraj, a domestic help in the household of the Talwars.  On 2008 the dead body of Hemraj was recovered from the terrace of the same house, i.e.  , house no.  L-32, Jalvayu Vihar, Sector 25, Noida, where Aarushis murder had also allegedly been committed.  2.  The initial investigation into the double murder was carried out by the U.P.  Police.  On 2008 the State of Uttar Pradesh handed over the investigation to the Central Bureau of Investigation (hereinafter referred to as, the CBI), thereupon investigation was conducted by the CBI.  3.  During the course of investigation, besides Dr.  Rajesh Talwar, the needle of suspicion came to be pointed towards Krishna Thadarai, Rajkumar and Vijay Mandal.  Dr.  Rajesh Talwar was arrested on Originally a three days remand was granted to interrogate him to the U.P.  Police.  Dr.  Rajesh Talwar remained in police and judicial custody from time to time, wherefrom, he was eventually released on bail on The other three individuals, namely, Krishna Thadarai, Rajkumar and Vijay Mandal were also arrested by the police.  Since investigation against the aforesaid three could not be completed within the period of 90 days, they were ordered to be released on bail.  4.  Having investigated into the matter for a considerable length of time, the CBI submitted a closure report on The reasons depicted in the closure report indicated the absence of sufficient evidence to prove the alleged offences against the accused Dr.  Rajesh Talwar, beyond reasonable doubt.  A summary of the reasons recorded in the said report itself, are being extracted hereunder: Despite best efforts by investigating team, some of the major shortcomings in the evidence are :- i.  No blood of Hemraj was found on the bed sheet and pillow of Aarushi.  There is no evidence to prove that Hemraj was killed in the room of Aarushi.  ii.  Dragging mark on steps only indicate that murder has taken place somewhere other than the terrace.  iii.  On the clothes of Dr.  Rajesh Talwar, only the blood of Aarushi was found but there was no trace of blood of Hemraj.  iv.  The clothes that Dr.  Nupur Talwar was wearing in the photograph taken by Aarushi in the night of the incident were seized by CBI but no blood was found during forensic examination.  vs Murder weapons were not recovered immediately after the offence.  One of the murder weapon i.e.  sharp edged instrument could not be recovered till date and expert could not find any blood stain or DNA of victims from golf stick to directly link it to the crime.  vi.  There is no evidence to explain the finger prints on the scotch bottle (which were found along with blood stains of both the victims on the bottle).  As per police diary, it was taken into possession on 16th morning itself.  In spite of best efforts, the fingerprint(s) could not be identified.  vii.  The guards of the colony are mobile during night and at the entrance they do not make any entry.  Therefore, their statements regarding movement of persons may not be foolproof.  viii.  Scientific tests on Dr.  Rajesh Talwar and Dr.  Nupur Talwar have not conclusively indicated their involvement in the crime.  ix.  The exact sequence of events between (in the intervening night of 15-16/05/2008) 08 mid night to 6:00 AM in the morning is not clear.  No evidence has emerged to show the clear role of Dr.  Rajesh Talwar and Dr.  Nupur Talwar, individually, in the commission of crime.  x.  A board of experts constituted during earlier investigation team has given an opinion that the possibility of the neck being cut by khukri cannot be ruled out, although doctors who have conducted postmortem have said that cut was done by surgically trained person with a small surgical instrument.  xi.  There is no evidence to explain the presence of Hemrajs mobile in Punjab after murder.  xii.  The offence has occurred in an enclosed flat hence no eye witness are available.  xiii.  The blood soaked clothes of the offenders, clothes used to clean the blood from the flat and stair case, the sheet on which the Hemraj was carried and dragged on the roof, the bed cover which was used to cover the view from the steel iron grill on the roof are not available and hence could not be recovered.  26.  The investigation revealed several suspicious actions by the parents post occurrence, but the circumstantial evidence collected during investigation has critical and substantial gaps.  There is absence of a clear cut motive and incomplete understanding of the sequence of events and non-recovery of the weapon of offence and their link to either the servants or the parents.  In view of the aforesaid shortcomings in the evidence, it is felt that sufficient evidence is not available to prove the offence(s) U/s 302/201 Indian Penal Code, 1860 against accused Dr.  Rajesh Talwar beyond reasonable doubt.

Indisputably, there is no eye-witness to the occurrence.  The entire prosecution case is based on circumstantial evidence.  In proving its case against the respondents, the prosecution mainly relied upon the evidence of PW3 (the driver of a taxi) and PW6 (son-in-law of the deceased).  The First Information Report was lodged by one G.  Damodar Reddy (son of the deceased and husband of the accused no.1).  According to him, on the aforementioned day and time, five persons had come to his house.  They sat with his father in the drawing room for about half an hour.

She had also given her gold Pusthalatadu to accused no.2 on being asked.  During the course of the incident, they tied her also with a saree.  4.  PW6 thereafter took accused no.1 to CCS, Hyderabad and handed her over to the Inspector of Police (PW14).  She was interrogated whereupon she led the police to a village commonly known as Arutla.

There is no dispute that the deceased was at advance stage of pregnancy and she died in the 2 night between 21-22 May, 1986 at her father-in-law's at village Salkhani.

Seeing dead body of Maya they perceived her death to be suspicious and hence gave report to the Chourai Police Station. On receipt thereof, inquest report (Ex.

After the marriage of the deceased with the appellant on .1985, deceased came to her father-in-law's place at village Salkhani only 3-4 times and although appellant used -to go to meet his wife at village Parasia, but was not happy with the articles given at the time of marriage and had kept the same at the parents' place of the deceased at Paresis. Appellant further used to demand Scooter and had suspicion about his wife's fidelity and believed that she had illicit relationship with her brother-in-law Radhakishan i.e. husband of Rajkumari (P.W.10). Immediately prior to the incident appellant and deceased had gone to Radhakrishnan's House at Vidisha. After returning from Vidisha to Parasia, in spite of the request made, appellant did not stay with his wife there and went along with the 3 deceased to his village Salkhani, although deceased was not inclined to go. On 1986, the villagers heard the cries of the deceased. She was done to death by the appellant and in order to conceal the crime, he projected that she died of vomiting. While preparing the inquest report it was found that there were red and blue spots on the face and chest of the deceased and thin blood coming out from the nostrils and as such the death was found to be suspicious and accordingly the dead body of Maya was sent for post-mortem examination. The Post mortem was conducted by a team of doctors consisting of Dr. V.E.Chako (P.W.7) and Dr. K.D. Khan and they submitted the post-mortem report (Ex. P/12) signed by both of them. According to the post-mortem report and the evidence of Dr. Chako (P.W.7), Maya's death was \"asphyxiat as a result of suffocation\". On enquiry by the investigating officer, Dr. Chako opined that swelling between Pomum adeomi and the border of the breast was ante- mortem in nature and could have been possible by pressing hard the chest and smothering by an object like soft pillow. The investigating agency also sent the earth containing vomited material for chemical examination to the 4 Forensic Science Laboratory.

Muttukumar (hereinafter referred to as the `deceased') was working as a manager in the said hotel.  Considering the nature of their work the accused as well as Muttukumar used to stay overnight in the hotel.  On 1995 in the evening complainant Anthony Xavier went to the Hotel Premier and after usual supervision and talk with manager at night he returned.  At that time the accused as well as Muttukumar were in the hotel.  On the next day morning i.e.  on 1995 one Murugan Shetiya working in the hotel went to Anthony (PW-1) and told him that the hotel is open and Muttukumar and accused are not present in the hotel.  He also informed that cash drawer was open and tape recorder was found missing.  Naturally, complainant Anthony immediately went to the hotel.  When he was making query, Arun Pujari, who was running Pan bidi shop near the hotel and taxi 2 driver Suresh Kumar who often used to park his taxi near the hotel told him that accused met them at about 30 a.m.  , and made enquiry about the bus going to Bangalore.  When complainant took survey of the hotel he found that cash box was open and tape recorder kept in the hotel was missing.  There was no cash in the cash box.  According to him on the previous night the manager i.e.  deceased had informed him that on that day amount of rs.3500/- was collected and the same was kept in the cash box.  Report was lodged with the police and investigation was undertaken.  Appellant was suspected to be the murderer.  After completion of investigation charge-sheet was filed.  Since the accused pleaded innocence, trial was held.  Though there was no direct evidence the Trial Court held that the circumstantial evidences adduced by the prosecution were sufficient.  Particular reference was made to the extra- judicial confession made before PW- Accordingly, conviction was recorded by the Trial Court.  Appellant filed appeal before the High Court which upheld the conviction.  Before the High Court the stand was that even if the extra judicial confession is accepted to be correct for the sake of argument, case under Section 302 Indian Penal Code, 1860 is not made out.  The stand of the prosecution was that the 3 extra-judicial confession clearly showed both the intention and the knowledge.  Accordingly, the High Court dismissed the appeal.  The stand taken before the High Court was reiterated by the parties.  In addition, learned counsel for the appellant submitted that there was no pre-meditation and in the course of quarrel, a wooden log which was lying was picked up by the appellant in a heat of passion and assault was made.  Only one blow was given and, therefore, Section 302 Indian Penal Code, 1860, in any event, has no application.  It was submitted that extra-judicial confession is a very weak piece of evidence and should not have been made the basis for conviction.  4.  We shall first deal with the question regarding claim of extra judicial confession.  Though it is not necessary that the witness should speak the exact words but there cannot be vital and material difference.  While dealing with a stand of extra judicial confession, Court has to satisfy itself that the same was voluntary and without any coercion and undue influence.  Extra judicial confession can form the basis of conviction if persons before whom it is stated to be made appear to be unbiased and not even remotely inimical to the accused.  Where there is material to show animosity, Court has to proceed cautiously and find out whether confession just like any other evidence depends on veracity of witness to whom it is made.  It is not invariable that the Court should not accept such evidence if actual words as 4 claimed to have been spoken are not reproduced and the substance is given.  It will depend on circumstance of the case.  If substance itself is sufficient to prove culpability and there is no ambiguity about import of the statement made by accused, evidence can be acted upon even though substance and not actual words have been stated.  Human mind is not a tape recorder which records what has been spoken word by word.  The witness should be able to say as nearly as possible actual words spoken by the accused.  That would rule out possibility of erroneous interpretation of any ambiguous statement.  If word by word repetition of statement of the case is insisted upon, more often than not evidentiary value of extra judicial confession has to be thrown out as unreliable and not useful.  That cannot be a requirement in law.  There can be some persons who have a good memory and may be able to repost exact words and there may he many who are possessed of normal memory and do so.  It is for the Court to judge credibility of the witness's capacity and thereafter to decide whether his or her evidence has to be accepted or not.  If Court believes witnesses before whom confession is made and is satisfied that confession was voluntary basing on such evidence, conviction can be founded.  Such confession should be clear, specific and unambiguous.  5 5.  The expression `confession' is not defined in the Evidence Act, `Confession' is a statement made by an accused which must either admit in terms the offence, or at any rate substantially all the facts which constitute the offence.  The dictionary meaning of the word `statement' is \"act of stating; that which is stated; a formal account, declaration of facts etc.  \" The word `statement' includes both oral and written statement.  Communication to another is not however an essential component to constitute a `statement'.  An accused might have been over-heard uttering to himself or saying to his wife or any other person in confidence.  He might have also uttered something in soliloquy.  He might also keep a note in writing.  All the aforesaid nevertheless constitute a statement.  It such statement is an admission of guilt, it would amount to a confession whether it is communicated to another or not.  This very question came up for consideration before this Court in Sahoo vs State of Uttar Pradesh, AIR [1966 SC 40:](/cgi- bin/LawCite?cit=1966%20SC%2040) (1966 Cr1 U 68).  After referring to some passages written by well known authors on the \"Law of Evidence\" Subba Rao, J.  (as he then was) held that \"communication is not a necessary ingredient to constitute confession\".  In paragraph 5 of the judgment, this Court held as follows: .Admissions and confessions are exceptions to the hearsay rule.  The Evidence Act places them in the category of relevant evidence presumably on the ground that as they are declarations against the interest of the person making them, they are probably true.  The 6 probative value of an admission or a confession goes not to depend upon its communication to another, though, just like any other piece of evidence, it can be admitted in evidence only on proof.  This proof in the case of oral admission or confession can be offered only by witnesses who heard the admission pr confession.  as the case may be.  If, as we have said, statement is the genus and confession is only a sub-species of that genus, we do not see any reason why the statement implied in the confession should be given a different meaning.  We, therefore, hold that a statement, whether communicated or not, admitting guilt is a confession of guilt (Emphasis supplied) 6.  The extra-judicial confession purported to have been made before PW1 reads as follows: \"He was brought to the hotel in a taxi.  In enquired with the accd.  what he did to Muttukumar.  The accd.  disclosed that he and Muttukumar got up at about 30 a.m.  and while he was preparing spices there was quarrel between them; and as a result of the quarrel he had hit Muttukumar with a wooden log used for cutting vegetables and Muttukumar had died of the injuries sustained during the assault.  \" 7.  In the instant case the extra-judicial confession is believable as rightly done by the Trial Court and the High Court.  The same not was made to a stranger but to a friend.  Therefore, the Trial Court and the High Court have rightly acted upon the extra-judicial confession.  At the same time the 7 background in which the assault has been made clearly shows that Section 302 Indian Penal Code, 1860 has no application.  The assault was made in the course of sudden quarrel without pre-meditation.  The accused was not armed at the relevant point of time.  Even according to prosecution he picked up the wooden log which was lying there and made the assault.", "statute": ["s3", "s2"]}, "2013.INSC.246.txt": {"doc_url": "http://www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/2013/246/.html", "explanation": {"Sunil was killed in a fake encounter by the officials of Police Station Bawal, District Rewari.": ["s3"], "On persuasion of SHO Sadhu Singh, the dead body of Sunil was consigned to flames.": ["s2"]}, "fact": " According to the appellant, in the night intervening 12/10/2008 and 13/10/2008, his son - Sunil was killed in a fake encounter by the officials of Police Station Bawal, District Rewari.

Thomas & R.P.  Sethi.  SETHI,J.  L.I.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.J Being some of the accused along with 152 others involved in what is popularly known as Coimbatore-Bomb Blast Case, the petitioners have prayed for the transfer of case PRC no.54 of 1998 pending in the Court of FCJ Magistrate Court, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu entitled State vs Abdul Nazir Madani and others to any Sessions Court in the State of Kerala allegedly on the ground of there being no possibility of fair trial in the State of Tamil Nadu.  It is alleged that in the State of Tamil Nadu both Hindu and Muslim fundamentalists are inciting trouble which has surcharged the communal atmosphere in that State making the conduct of the fair trial impossible.  It is apprehended that the witnesses will not be in a position to give evidence without fear or favour.  The petitioner Abdul Nazar Madani has referred to some attack on him by RSS Cadres during August, 1992 as a consequence of which he sustained injuries which ultimately resulted in the imputation of his right leg.  He has two children aged four and one year old and a wife from a very poor family.  He claims to be the founder of Al-amwar islamic Madrass and Orphanage in Kollam District in Kerala where about 280 orphans are stated to be studying for whose day to day expenses an amount of rs.2050/- is required which is not possible to procure in his absence.  He has further claimed to be the leader of an organisation named \"Islamic Seva Sangh\" which, according to him, was a social and cultural organisation.  The said organisation is stated to have been declared as unlawful organisation in the State of Kerala after the demolition of Babri Masjid.  Thereafter the said petitioner is stated to have organised a party named Peoples Democratic Party.  He submits that there exists a feeling generally in Tamilnadu, Chennai and Coimbatore that the petitioner was an ISI (Pakistani Intelligence Service) agent who was responsible for the bomb blasts in the city of Coimbatore in Tamilnadu.  It is alleged that a popular opinion appears to have been formed that no patriotic lawyer from Tamilnadu would appear and plead the case of the petitioners, as they thought it as anti- national and due to intimidation by the Police Intelligence Wing, lawyers are not willing to take up their briefs.  On their behalf some advocates from Kerala are stated to have visited Coimbatore and Chennai with a request to local lawyers there to cooperate with the petitioners and conduct their cases but all of them are stated to have refused.  It is submitted that being a well known political leader in the State of Kerala, the respondents have falsely implicated petitioner Madani, with others in the criminal cases.  In the counter affidavit filed on behalf of the respondents it is submitted that the petitioners along with@@ JJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ others are involved in Coimbatore B-1 Bazar Police Station@@ JJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ CR no.151 of 1998 under Sections 120B, 302, 307, 449, 465, 468, 471, 212, 153A(1), 148, 149, 201, 109, 114 and 353 Indian Penal Code, 1860, Sections 3, 4 (b), 5, 6 of the [Explosive Substances Act, 1908](http://www.liiofindia.org/in/legis/cen/num_act/esa1908252/), Section 25(1-B)(a) of the [Arms Act, 1959](http://www.liiofindia.org/in/legis/cen/num_act/aa195968/) and Section 4 of the Tamil Nadu Property (Prevention of Damage and Loss) Act, The petitioner, Madani is stated to be the prime accused concerned in the Serial Bomb Blast Case of Coimbatore.  It is alleged that on 1998 at about 4 p.m.  when Shri L.K.  Advani, the then President of Bhartiya Janta Party was to address election meeting at RS Puram, Coimbatore City, the whole of the city and its suburbs were hit by a series of 12 powerful bomb blasts killing 47 persons and injuring 218 persons apart from causing extensive damage to the properties owned primarily by a particular section of the society.  The high intensity bombs/Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) exploded all over the city and its suburbs including near the venue of the public meeting.  The bomb blasts were targeted at some specified congregations and their establishments.  Shri L.K.  Advani was planned to be targeted by Suicide Squad members armed with \"instantaneous-type bombs\" tied to their waists and \"throw-type bombs\", which, however, could not materialise since neither the members of the suicide squad charged with the task could penetrate the police cardon and reach near the public meeting place, nor Shri Advani was available at the targeted place at the scheduled time due to delay of his flight.  The blasts had been planned and executed by the muslim fundamentalists organisation named \"Al-Umma\" headed by sectionA.  Basha, co- accused no.1 in the case allegedly as a brutal answer/retaliation to the killing of 18 muslims in communal riots and police firing and extensive damages to the muslim properties following the stabbing to death of a Traffic Police Constable Selvaraj at Ukkadam, Coimbatore on There were some other bomb blasts resulting in total the death of 58 persons besides injuring 250 persons.  Private and public properties to the tune of rs.37 crores is also stated to have been damaged.  The petitioner Madani has admitted to be the founder leader of Islamic Seva Sangh and presently the leader of Peoples Democratic party.  He was arrested at Kozhikode on 1998 in connection with Kozhikode Kasba PS Cr.  No.103/92 u/s 153-A and B Indian Penal Code, 1860 and in the case in Cr.  No.62/98 under Section 120(B) 212 Indian Penal Code, 1860 and under Section 3 read with Section 25(1)(a) [Arms Act, 1959](http://www.liiofindia.org/in/legis/cen/num_act/aa195968/) and was remanded to judicial custody and lodged in Central Prison, Cannanore, Kerala State.  His involvement in the Coimbatore Series Bomb Blast case came to light from the alleged confession statement made by accused Tajudeen @ Abu Mujahith, Accused no.3 on 26th March, Other accused persons were arrested from different places on different dates.  Regarding allegations of the petitioners which have been made basis for seeking transfer, the respondents have submitted that it was not correct to state that there existed feelings in Tamil Nadu in general or in Chennai and Coimbature in particular, that no patriotic lawyer would appear and plead for any of the accused persons in the Bomb Blast cases.  The submission of the petitioners is alleged to be illusory.  Advocates from Chennai, Vijayawada and Coimbatore are stated to have already appeared for the accused in the courts at Coimbature and also before the High Court of Judicature at Chennai.  A list of such advocates has been annexed with the counter affidavit as Annexure A.  Regarding the existence of an alleged surcharged communal atmosphere, it is submitted that there is presently no communal tension in Tamil Nadu as communal harmony is maintained in the State.  The situation which was created in the aftermath of series bomb blasts in February, 1998 has since been completely defused and normalised due to the strong measures taken by the fair and firm investigagion of the case and by the law and order machinery.  The atmosphere in the State is stated to be peaceful and the trial is assured to be conducted peacefully and smoothly.  The submission of the petitioners that they will not get any assistance of lawyers of their choice due to rivalry of religious fundamentalists is false and concocted, deliberately put as a ground to stall and delay the progress of the case.  The proposed transfer would cause inconvenience not only to the prosecution but also other co- accused persons.  Most of the witnesses are in Tamil Nadu and to ensure the speedy trial of the case the prayer of the petitioner is liable to be rejected.  We have heard the learned counsel for the parties and perused the records.  Appearing for the respondents Shri V.R.  Reddy, learned Senior Counsel has brought to our notice that charge-sheet had been laid against 181 accused persons out of whom 8 have died and 5 are still at large.  Remaining 168 accused are lodged in various prisons in the State of Tamil Nadu.  Out of 168 accused persons 154 are from Coimbatore, 7 from Kerala 2 from Karnataka and 2 from Andhra Pradesh.  Total number of witnesses which are likely to be produced are 2333 out of whom 2083 are Tamil speaking witnesses.  The Government has constituted a special court exclusively for the speedy trial of this case.  Remodelling of the building adjacent to the Central Prison, Coimbatore with the object of accommodating the special court was completed in January, 2000 at a cost of rs.40 lacs.  Final report under Section 173 Cr.  P.C.  consisting of statements and documents which runs into 16480 pages in Tamil has been submitted.  Total copies running into 37 lakh pages have been made and supplied to the accused persons on 27th March, Shri Thanikachalam, the Special Judge has taken charge on The learned counsel has also shown us the sketch regarding the location of the Central Prison and the special court specially constituted for the trial of bomb blast case along with photographs of the specially made cells where all the accused persons are intended to be accommodated during the trial of the case.  Dr.  Singhvi, the learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioner has drawn our attention to various averments made in the petition particularly in paras 16, 17 and 25 to urge that in view of existing surcharged atmosphere it was not possible to have a fair trial of the accused persons in the State of Tamil Nadu.  In the alternative he has submitted that if the transfer of the case from the State of Tamil Nadu is not possible, the same be transferred to any court at Chennai, Thirunalveli, Salem in the State of Tamil Nadu.  Relying upon G.X Francis & Ors.v.  Banke Bihari Singh & Anr.[AIR [1958 SC 309]](/cgi- bin/LawCite?cit=1958%20SC%20309), he has argued that in view of the surcharged communal tension in the area, the local atmosphere not being conducive to fair and impartial trial, there existed good ground for the transfer of the case to another State.  In support of his submissions he has referred to Annexure P-3, proceedings of the Commissioner of Police, Coimbatore City which is an order passed under the National Security Act dated Relying upon the averments made therein to the effect that \"Coimbatore City has become a communally hypersensitive place in the recent years in view of the communal riots.  On 1997 at Ukkadam Traffic Point, Selvaraj, a Traffic Police Constable on duty was brutally murdered by the muslim youths belonging to Al-Umma.  This resulted in the outburst of a major communal harmony\", the learned counsel has submitted that in the interests of justice and for fair trial of the case, the prayer made in the petition is justified.  The purpose of the criminal trial is to dispense fair and impartial justice uninfluenced by extraneous considerations.  When it is shown that public confidence in the fairness of a trial would be seriously undermined, any party can seek the transfer of a case within the State under Section 407 and anywhere in the country under Section 406 of the Cr.  P.C.  The apprehension of not getting a fair and impartial inquiry or trial is required to be reasonable and not imaginary based upon conjectures and surmises.  If it appears that the dispensation of criminal justice is not possible impartially and objectively and without any bias, before any court or even at any place, the appropriate court may transfer the case to another court where it feels that holding of fair and proper trial is conducive.  No universal or hard and fast rules can be prescribed for deciding a transfer petition which has always to be decided on the basis of the facts of each case.  Convenience of the parties including the witnesses to be produced at the trial is also a relevant consideration for deciding the transfer petition.  The convenience of the parties does not necessarily mean the convenience of the petitioners alone who approached the court on misconceived notions of apprehension.  Convenience for the purposes of transfer means the convenience of the prosecution, other accused, the witnesses and the larger interest of the society.  In G.X.  Francis's case (supra) this Court felt that where public confidence in the fairness of the trial is likely to be seriously undermined under the circumstances of the case, transfer petition could be allowed.  On finding that \"there is uniformity of testimony from both sides about the nature of surcharged communal tension in that area\", the Court found that the local atmosphere was not conducive to a fair and impartial trial which justified a good ground for transfer.  The court rejected the contention of the petitioner therein regarding the wild allegations made to the effect that no court in the State of M.P.  would be unbiased or impartial for dispensing justice.  In the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case, the trial was transferred to an adjoining court.  The mere existence of a surcharged atmosphere without there being proof of inability for holding fair and impartial trial cannot be made a ground for transfer of a case.  Alleged communally surcharged atmosphere has to be considered in the light of the accusations made and the nature of the crime committed by the accused seeking transfer of his case.  It will be unsafe to hold that as and when accusations are made regarding the existence of a surcharged communal atmosphere, the case should be transferred from the area where existence of such surcharged atmosphere is alleged.  This Court had not concluded so generally in Francis's case as has been argued before us on behalf of the petitioner.  On facts also we find that petitioners in the instant case have made wild and general allegations of the surcharged atmosphere against a particular community of the society in the whole of the State of Tamil Nadu.  We are of the opinion that in a secular, democratic country governed by the rule of law, the appropriate State Government is responsible for ensuring free, fair and impartial trial to the accused notwithstanding the nature of accusations made against them.  Nothing has been placed on record nor was it possible to allege that the whole of the State of Tamil Nadu has become a communal State which cannot ensure a free, fair and impartial trial against the petitioners.  If such a situation is shown to be existing, the State Government has no constitutional and moral right to rule the State as it would amount to perpetuating the continuance of a Government against the provisions of the Constitution which ensures and guarantees of a secular, democratic system of governance.  The respondent have very emphatically submitted and we have no reason to doubt that the atmosphere in the State is not communally surcharged to the extent that holding of criminal trial against the petitioners and others is not possible in any part of the State.  Even if some communal tension is shown to be in existence as perhaps is likely to be in view of the nature of offence committed and the accusations made against the petitioner and other accused persons, it is the obligation of the State Government to ensure the safety and security of the accused persons to stand free and impartial trial.  It is true that in the detention order dated 1998 against the petitioner, the Commissioner of Police has mentioned that on account of the communal riots the Coimbatore City had become communally hypersensitive but those averments cannot be stretched to hold firstly that the whole State of Tamil Nadu has become communally surcharged and secondly that Coimbatore City itself continues to be so communally hypersensitive till date that the trial against the petitioners and other accused persons is not likely to be free, fair and impartial.  In the counter affidavit the respondents have specifically stated: \"With regard to the averments in Ground (A) of the petition, it is submitted that it is not correct to state that the communal tension is prevailing in the State of Tamil Nadu and both Muslim and Hindu fundamentalist are inciting troubles which will lead to communal tension is presently no communal tension in Tamil Nadu and communal harmony is maintained in the State.  The situation that was created in the aftermath of the serial bomb blasts of February, 1998, has been since completely defused and normalised due to the strong measures taken by the fair and firm investigation of the case and by the Law & Order machinery.  The atmosphere in the State is peaceful.  Hence the trial will be conducted peacefully and smoothly.  \" After perusing Annexure A we do not find any substance in the submission of the petitioners that as they and other accused persons are not likely to get proper legal assistance, the case should be transferred to some other State.  We are also satisfied that the petitioners and other accused are adequately represented in the court and even if not, they can get the legal services from Palghat in Kerala where they want the case to be transferred.  It may be noticed that Palghat is approximately 40 kilometers from Coimbatore and it is not difficult for any number of advocates to travel or stay at Coimbatore during the conduct of the trial.  We are sure that if any advocate from outside the State of Tamil Nadu appears for any of the accused, the State Government shall provide him appropriate security to ensure him the discharge of his professional obligation towards the accused persons facing the trial in the case filed against them.  Dr.  Singhvi, the learned counsel appearing for the petitioners alternatively submitted that even if this Court does not find any ground to transfer the case of the petitioner from the State of Tamil Nadu to any other State, particularly the State of Kerala, the trial of the case be ordered to be conducted at some other place in the State of Tamil Nadu preferably at Chennai, Thirunalveli or Salem.  We are not satisfied with this submission also as we are of the opinion that at present there exists conducive atmosphere at Coimbatore where free, fair and impartial trial is possible to be conducted against the accused persons.", "statute": ["s3", "s2"]}}
